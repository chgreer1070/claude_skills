# YAML and TOML Libraries

This repository uses `ruamel.yaml` for all YAML operations and `tomlkit` for TOML read-write operations.

- Use `ruamel.yaml` for YAML — never `pyyaml` (`import yaml`)
- Use `tomlkit` for TOML read-write operations
- `tomllib` (stdlib) is acceptable for read-only TOML in stdlib-only contexts
- For frontmatter parsing/writing, use the shared module: `from frontmatter_utils import load_frontmatter, dump_frontmatter`
