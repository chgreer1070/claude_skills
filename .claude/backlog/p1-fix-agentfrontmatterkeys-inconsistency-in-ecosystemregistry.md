name: Fix agent_frontmatter_keys inconsistency in ecosystem_registry
description: '`plugins/plugin-creator/scripts/ecosystem_registry.py:get_ecosystem_owned_keys()` unions only `skill_frontmatter_keys` across registered ecosystems, ignoring `agent_frontmatter_keys`. The sibling function `get_ecosystem_for_key()` correctly checks both fields. This inconsistency means agent files using ecosystem-owned keys would not be protected by the guard set built from `get_ecosystem_owned_keys()`. Current impact is zero because `agent_frontmatter_keys` is empty for all registered ecosystems, but the data model supports future ecosystems and the inconsistency is a latent correctness bug. The fix should union both fields and update the docstring. A test covering the `agent_frontmatter_keys` branch in `get_ecosystem_for_key()` is also missing and must be added.'
