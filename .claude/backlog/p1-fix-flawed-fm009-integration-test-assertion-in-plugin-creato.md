name: Fix flawed FM009 integration test assertion in plugin-creator
description: "In `plugins/plugin-creator/tests/test_frontmatter_fixes.py` line 251, the FM009 assertion uses `str.split('fm009')[1:]` with the `in` operator against a list, which tests list membership rather than substring presence. The assertion always passes regardless of actual output — it provides zero test coverage of its stated intent. The fix should use `str.partition('fm009')[2]` and a substring `in` check so the assertion actually fails when the validator incorrectly emits FM009 for an mcp: field. All 26 existing tests must continue to pass after the fix."

## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **fix flawed fm009 integration test assertion in plugin-creator** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

In `plugins/plugin-creator/tests/test_frontmatter_fixes.py` line 251, the FM009 assertion uses `str.split('fm009')[1:]` with the `in` operator against a list, which tests list membership rather than substring presence. The assertion always passes regardless of actual output — it provides zero test coverage of its stated intent. The fix should use `str.partition('fm009')[2]` and a substring `in` check so the assertion actually fails when the validator incorrectly emits FM009 for an mcp: field. All 26 existing tests must continue to pass after the fix.

## Acceptance Criteria
