## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **kaizen: mcp consolidation analysis** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

The plugin currently runs two MCP servers (`kaizen-duckdb` via mcp-server-motherduck, `kaizen-analysis` via server.py) plus a standalone CLI script (`sentiment-score.py`). Investigate: (1) What does each MCP server provide that the other cannot? Can they be merged into a single server? (2) Why is `sentiment-score.py` a standalone script rather than an MCP tool inside `server.py`? What would be gained or lost by moving scoring into the MCP server (always-on scoring, no manual invocation, lock ownership)? (3) Is there a clean boundary between "batch processing" (script) and "query/serve" (MCP) that should be preserved?
**Decision needed**: Consolidate vs. keep separate, with rationale.
