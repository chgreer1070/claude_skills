## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **expose backlog items and index as mcp resources in backlog_core** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

backlog_core exposes only tools. MCP resources are the correct primitive for readable, addressable content. Backlog items are a natural fit: each is a file with a stable identifier (issue number or title slug).

MCP clients that support resources can browse, subscribe, and read items without calling tools. This is a lower-friction access pattern for read-only consumers (e.g., a client that wants to render a backlog view).

Proposed resources:
- `backlog://index` — JSON list of all open items (title, priority, issue, plan) — static resource
- `backlog://item/{selector}` — full content of a single item; selector = issue number or title slug — resource template
- `backlog://item/{selector}/body` — raw GitHub issue body — resource template

Files affected: `.claude/skills/backlog/backlog_core/server.py`

Source: FastMCP v3 docs `servers/resources.mdx` — `@mcp.resource("uri://pattern")` and `@mcp.resource("uri://{param}")` for resource templates.

## Acceptance Criteria
