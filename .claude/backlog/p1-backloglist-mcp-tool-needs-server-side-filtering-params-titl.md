## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **backlog_list mcp tool needs server-side filtering params (title, section, status)** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

Agents pipe backlog_list JSON output through python3 -c to filter by title substring, section, or status — observed in work-backlog-item Step 0 (interactive browser), Step 1 (title search), and groom-backlog-item Step 1 (section filter). This is a design error: if the consumer must post-process to get useful results, the tool's interface is incomplete. Add optional filter params to backlog_list: title (case-insensitive substring match), section (P0|P1|P2|Ideas), status (open|closed|in-progress). Apply filters server-side in operations.list_items() before returning results. backlog_view already handles single-item lookup by selector — this gap is specifically the list-then-filter pattern for subsets. Also add the same params to the CLI (backlog.py list --title X --section P1 --status open) for parity.
