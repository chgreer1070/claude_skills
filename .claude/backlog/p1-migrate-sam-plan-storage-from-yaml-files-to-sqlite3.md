name: Migrate SAM plan storage from YAML files to SQLite3
description: 'Agents currently edit YAML plan files directly (task status, TN verification, timestamps) instead of going through a programmatic mutation layer. This is fragile — agents can misformat YAML, corrupt structure, or write invalid values. Replace YAML file storage with SQLite3 database. The sam CLI already has the right interface shape (state, ready, status, claim) — the backend changes from file I/O to SQL. SQLite gives proper CRUD, transactions, atomic updates, and structured queries. Covers: task files, T0/TN verification reports, plan artifacts.'

## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **migrate sam plan storage from yaml files to sqlite3** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

Agents currently edit YAML plan files directly (task status, TN verification, timestamps) instead of going through a programmatic mutation layer. This is fragile — agents can misformat YAML, corrupt structure, or write invalid values. Replace YAML file storage with SQLite3 database. The sam CLI already has the right interface shape (state, ready, status, claim) — the backend changes from file I/O to SQL. SQLite gives proper CRUD, transactions, atomic updates, and structured queries. Covers: task files, T0/TN verification reports, plan artifacts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Work matches description
- [ ] Plan or implementation complete

## Context

- **Source**: Session observation 2026-03-20: agents editing YAML files directly instead of using programmatic mutations
- **Priority**: P1
- **Added**: 2026-03-20
- **Research questions**: None
