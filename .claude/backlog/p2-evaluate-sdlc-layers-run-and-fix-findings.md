## Story

As a **maintainer of the project infrastructure**, I want to **evaluate-sdlc-layers: run and fix findings** so that **the project infrastructure stays healthy**.

## Description

The evaluate-sdlc-layers skill exists with six checks (cross-refs, doc completeness, knowledge-explorer, research metadata, integration points, plan consistency). Run `/evaluate-sdlc-layers` and address any findings. Success: all checks pass with `--fix` applied where applicable.

## Suggested Location

`.claude/skills/evaluate-sdlc-layers/SKILL.md`; run against `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/`

## Context

- **Source**: Session observation — SDLC layer implementation (2026-02-23)
- **Priority**: P2
- **Added**: 2026-02-23
- **Research questions**: None

## RT-ICA

RT-ICA Final: evaluate-sdlc-layers: Run and fix findings
Goal: Run the six-check evaluate-sdlc-layers skill and fix all findings with --fix where applicable.
Conditions:
1. Skill file exists at .claude/skills/evaluate-sdlc-layers/SKILL.md | Snapshot: AVAILABLE → Final: AVAILABLE | Citation: Glob confirmed, Read verified frontmatter name: evaluate-sdlc-layers
2. Six checks match description (cross-refs, doc completeness, knowledge-explorer, research metadata, integration points, plan consistency) | Snapshot: DERIVABLE → Final: AVAILABLE | Citation: fact-checker read SKILL.md, confirmed exactly 6 numbered sections matching all names
3. Target directory .claude/docs/sdlc-layers/ exists and has content | Snapshot: DERIVABLE → Final: AVAILABLE | Citation: fact-checker confirmed Layer 0 (9 files), Layer 1 (6 files) present; Layer 2 MISSING (expected gap the skill will flag)
4. --fix flag supported by the skill | Snapshot: DERIVABLE → Final: AVAILABLE | Citation: fact-checker found argument-hint: '[--dry-run | --fix]' at SKILL.md line 4
5. Success criteria: all checks pass | Snapshot: AVAILABLE → Final: AVAILABLE | Citation: description states "Success: all checks pass with --fix applied where applicable"

Changes from snapshot:
- Condition 2: DERIVABLE → AVAILABLE (resolved by fact-checker reading SKILL.md directly)
- Condition 3: DERIVABLE → AVAILABLE (resolved by fact-checker; Layer 2 missing is a known expected finding, not a blocker)
- Condition 4: DERIVABLE → AVAILABLE (resolved by fact-checker finding --fix in argument-hint)

New conditions discovered by swarm:
- Layer 2 directory (.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/layer-2/) is missing — this is the primary finding the skill will report; not a grooming blocker, it IS the work

Decision: APPROVED — all conditions AVAILABLE. Item is ready for planning phase.

## Fact-Check

## Fact-Check Summary

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Skill exists at `.claude/skills/evaluate-sdlc-layers/SKILL.md` | VERIFIED | File read successfully, contains frontmatter with name: evaluate-sdlc-layers |
| Skill has six checks: cross-refs, doc completeness, knowledge-explorer, research metadata, integration points, plan consistency | VERIFIED | SKILL.md contains exactly 6 numbered sections: 1. Cross-Reference Validation, 2. Doc Completeness, 3. Knowledge-Explorer Layer Filter, 4. Research Entry Layer Metadata, 5. Integration Points, 6. Consistency with Plan |
| `--fix` flag exists in skill | VERIFIED | SKILL.md line 4: `argument-hint: '[--dry-run \| --fix]'` and line 15 documents the flag: "After evaluation, apply safe fixes..." |
| Target dir `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` exists and has content | PARTIALLY VERIFIED | Directory exists with content; Layer 0 (9 files) and Layer 1 (6 files) complete. Layer 2 directory DOES NOT EXIST (expected by checks but not implemented). ARL layer has 2 files (arl-meta-layer.md, arl-human-probing-design.md). Root README exists. |

**File Count Verification:**
- Layer 0: 9 files present ✓ (README, sam-pipeline, arl-touchpoints, artifact-conventions, rt-ica-gate, verification-protocol, task-file-format, evidence-discipline, orchestrator-discipline)
- Layer 1: 6 files present ✓ (README, layer-1-overview, language-manifest-template, linting-discovery-protocol, workflow-pattern-taxonomy, harness-role-mapping)
- Layer 2: Directory missing ✗ (expected per SKILL.md Check 2 Doc Completeness section)
- ARL: 2 files present ✓ (arl-meta-layer.md, arl-human-probing-design.md)

**VERIFIED: 3, REFUTED: 0, INCONCLUSIVE: 1**

**Inconclusive Item:** Layer 2 implementation status — SKILL.md describes checking for Layer 2 files (README, layer-2-overview, stack-profile-schema, stack-profile-template, pilot profiles), but the layer-2 directory does not exist. This is expected per backlog item intent ("evaluate and fix findings"), not a factual claim error. The skill will correctly identify this gap during execution.

## Groomed (2026-03-21)


### Reproducibility

Run `/evaluate-sdlc-layers` against `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` to trigger the validation checks. The need for fixes is revealed when any of the six checks produces a FAIL or PARTIAL result:

1. **Cross-Reference Validation FAIL**: A linked path in `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` or related docs does not exist or points to wrong content (e.g., `plugins/development-harness/docs/layer-2/` missing, `TASK_FILE_FORMAT.md` at wrong location).
2. **Doc Completeness FAIL**: Expected files missing from Layer 0 (9 docs), Layer 1 (6 docs), Layer 2 (4+ docs), or ARL sections.
3. **Knowledge-Explorer FAIL**: `uv run research/knowledge-explorer.py list --layer {N}` returns entries without matching `layer:` metadata or misses entries that should have it.
4. **Research Metadata FAIL**: Entries like `evaluation-testing/harness-engineering-openai.md` or `api-frameworks/fastapi.md` lack correct `layer:` frontmatter field or related metadata (`language`, `stack`).
5. **Integration Points FAIL**: Skills (`work-backlog-item`, `groom-backlog-item`) or protocol docs fail to reference layer architecture or document layer inheritance.
6. **Plan Consistency FAIL**: Files implemented do not match File and Directory Changes table in attached plan, or dependency order is violated.

Reproduce: Run the skill with no arguments to get a report, then use `--fix` to apply safe corrections.

### Priority

**P2: Should-Have** — improves documentation consistency and prevents drift without blocking feature development.

**Justification**: The SDLC Layer Separation Architecture is foundational to the development workflow; incomplete or broken cross-references weaken its authority and trustworthiness. Documentation drift creates confusion for new contributors and agents. However, this is not urgent: it improves tooling quality, not core product functionality. P0 work (authentication, core services) and P1 work (critical tooling) take precedence. Once P0/P1 items stabilize, validation ensures the architectural foundation remains sound for scaling.

### Impact

**If this work is not done:**

- **Documentation drift**: Layer docs become inconsistent with actual implementation. New docs added without layer metadata; layer metadata gets out of sync with actual file structure. Agents and contributors lose trusted reference point.
- **Broken cross-references**: Skill docs (work-backlog-item, groom-backlog-item) link to layer docs that don't exist or have moved. Links rot; referenced protocols are inaccessible.
- **Research metadata gaps**: Research entries added without `layer:` field or with incorrect `stack` values. Knowledge-Explorer queries fail to filter correctly. SAM task generation cannot route work to correct layer.
- **Integration points unvalidated**: Skills claim to implement layer architecture but actual docs are incomplete or divergent. New agents inherit broken patterns.
- **Plan slippage**: Architectural plan is never verified against implementation. Divergences accumulate; initial investment in layers is wasted because no one confirms it works.
- **Scaled maintenance debt**: Each new entry, link, or cross-reference is a chance to introduce inconsistency. Without validation, debt compounds exponentially as codebase grows.

**Operationally**: Contributors become unsure whether layer docs are current, leading to either ignoring them or working around them. Layer architecture degrades from authoritative to aspirational.

### Expected Behavior

**Success state**: Running `/evaluate-sdlc-layers` produces a report with all six checks returning **PASS**:

```text
### Summary
- Cross-Reference: PASS
- Doc Completeness: PASS
- Knowledge-Explorer: PASS
- Research Metadata: PASS
- Integration Points: PASS
- Plan Consistency: PASS
```

With `--fix` applied, any auto-fixable issues (broken paths, missing frontmatter, obvious typos, missing directory stubs) are corrected, and the report documents each change made.

**Verification**: Re-running `/evaluate-sdlc-layers` after `--fix` should produce all PASS with zero findings reported. No regression in `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` or related docs.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1**: Run `/evaluate-sdlc-layers --dry-run` against `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` and review findings report. Document any FAIL or PARTIAL results observed.
- [ ] **AC2**: Run `/evaluate-sdlc-layers --fix` to apply safe corrections. Capture output showing what was changed (paths fixed, metadata added, etc.).
- [ ] **AC3**: Cross-references validation checks all 6+ linked paths in layer docs and confirms they exist with correct content.
- [ ] **AC4**: Doc completeness confirms all 9 Layer 0 docs, 6 Layer 1 docs, 4+ Layer 2 docs, and ARL docs are present at expected locations.
- [ ] **AC5**: Knowledge-Explorer layer filtering returns correctly tagged entries; entries without `layer:` metadata are excluded when `--layer` filter is used.
- [ ] **AC6**: Research metadata audit verifies sample entries (harness-engineering-openai.md, fastapi.md, copier-astral.md) have correct `layer:` frontmatter.
- [ ] **AC7**: Integration points audit confirms `work-backlog-item` SKILL and `groom-backlog-item` SKILL reference layer docs and document `--language`, `--stack` inheritance.
- [ ] **AC8**: Plan consistency check compares attached plan's File and Directory Changes table against actual implementation; no missing or diverged items.
- [ ] **AC9**: Re-run `/evaluate-sdlc-layers --dry-run` after fixes and confirm all six checks return PASS; zero findings reported.
- [ ] **AC10**: Verify no regression in `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` — all existing content preserved, new files/metadata are additions only.

### Files

**Files likely to be read or modified by the skill and fixes**:

**SDLC Layer Documentation** (read and validated):
- `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` (all files)
  - Layer 0: `README.md`, `sam-pipeline.md`, `arl-touchpoints.md`, `artifact-conventions.md`, `rt-ica-gate.md`, `verification-protocol.md`, `task-file-format.md`, `evidence-discipline.md`, `orchestrator-discipline.md`
  - Layer 1: `README.md`, `layer-1-overview.md`, `language-manifest-schema.md`, `language-manifest-template.md`, `linting-discovery-protocol.md`, `workflow-pattern-taxonomy.md`, `role-resolution-protocol.md`, `harness-role-mapping.md`
  - Layer 2: `README.md`, `layer-2-overview.md`, `stack-profile-schema.md`, `stack-profile-template.md`, pilot profiles
  - ARL: `arl-meta-layer.md`, `arl-human-probing-design.md`

**Research Entries** (read for metadata, potentially modified with `--fix`):
- `research/knowledge-explorer.py` — tested for layer filtering
- `research/evaluation-testing/harness-engineering-openai.md` — layer metadata checked
- `research/api-frameworks/fastapi.md`, `tornado.md` — layer and stack metadata checked
- `research/developer-tools/copier-astral.md` — layer metadata checked
- `research/README.md` — layer mapping section validated

**Skills** (read for integration point documentation):
- `.claude/skills/work-backlog-item/SKILL.md` — validated for layer integration, `--language`, `--stack` docs
- `.claude/plugins/development-harness/skills/groom-backlog-item/SKILL.md` — validated for ARL human-probing integration
- Protocol docs: `language-manifest-schema.md`, `role-resolution-protocol.md` — inheritance references validated

**Plan and Related** (if attached):
- Feature plan deliverables file (File and Directory Changes table) — validated against actual implementation

**Output Artifact**:
- Evaluation report written to stdout (no permanent file created unless agent saves it)

### Effort

**Estimate: Medium (4–8 hours)**

**Breakdown**:
- **Skill execution and report generation** (1–2 hours): Run the skill, parse findings, document observations for each of the 6 checks. Findings may be scattered across multiple files, requiring careful cross-referencing.
- **Cross-reference and path validation** (1–2 hours): Verify each of 6+ linked paths exists and contains expected content. If paths are broken, research correct locations or file the finding.
- **Metadata fixes** (1–2 hours): Add missing `layer:` frontmatter fields to research entries. Update `language` and `stack` tags where missing or incorrect. Validate syntax.
- **Documentation updates** (1 hour): Update SKILL docs to reference layer architecture if not already done. Ensure cross-links between work-backlog-item, groom-backlog-item, and layer docs are correct.
- **Verification and re-run** (1 hour): Re-run `/evaluate-sdlc-layers --dry-run` to confirm all fixes applied and zero findings remain. Spot-check a few key files for correctness.

**Complexity factors**:
- **Low-Medium risk**: The skill is designed to auto-fix "safe" issues (paths, metadata, typos). Breaking changes are unlikely unless docs are substantially reorganized.
- **Parallelizable**: Cross-reference checking, metadata audits, and skill doc updates can be done in parallel by an agent.
- **Tool-assisted**: The skill already knows what to check; most work is applying the skill's suggestions and verifying results.

**Success criterion**: All 6 checks PASS, zero findings, zero regression in existing docs.

### Impact Radius



## Impact Radius

### Code — Producers
- `.claude/skills/evaluate-sdlc-layers/SKILL.md` — Defines six validation checks and `--fix` flag that will modify target files. Check 1 validates cross-references; Check 2 validates doc completeness; Checks 3-6 validate metadata, integration, and plan consistency. Skill is read-only consumer of layer docs; produces validation report and applies fixes via safe operations.
- `research/knowledge-explorer.py` — Contains layer filtering logic (`--layer {0|1|2}` flag). Will be verified for correct filtering of entries with `layer:` frontmatter metadata. No changes expected; read-only during evaluation.

### Code — Consumers
- `research/knowledge-explorer.py` — Executes layer filtering on research entries. Depends on correct `layer:` frontmatter in `.md` files under `research/` directories. Will verify that entries tagged with `layer: "0"`, `layer: "1"`, `layer: "2"` are properly filtered by `--layer` flag.
- `plugins/development-harness/skills/work-backlog-item/SKILL.md` — Documents `--language` and `--stack` parameters that select Layer 1/2 profiles per skill frontmatter line 14. Integration point: must reference `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/` for layer model documentation. No code change expected; documentation verification only.
- `plugins/development-harness/skills/groom-backlog-item/SKILL.md` — Documents ARL human-probing integration. Integration point: may reference `arl-human-probing-design.md` for ARL design. No code change expected; documentation verification only.
- `plugins/development-harness/CLAUDE.md` — Declares layer model in line 64 ("This harness implements the **SDLC Layer Separation Architecture**..."). References `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/`. No code change expected; documentation reference only.

### Documentation (will become stale)
- `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/README.md` — Declares layer model structure, directory layout, and principles. Will be verified for correct cross-references and completeness. May need updates if layer-2 directory structure is incomplete or if any links are broken.
- `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/layer-0/README.md` — Expected to document all 9 Layer 0 files. Will be verified for completeness and cross-reference accuracy.
- `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/layer-1/README.md` — Expected to document all 6 Layer 1 files. Will be verified for completeness.
- `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/layer-0/sam-pipeline.md` — References work-backlog-item and groom-backlog-item skills. Will be verified for working cross-references.
- `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/arl-human-probing-design.md` — Expected to document human-probing integration for groom-backlog-item. Will be verified for existence and content accuracy.
- `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/layer-2/` — Expected directory (README, layer-2-overview, stack-profile-schema, stack-profile-template, pilot profiles). **Currently missing** — backlog item grooming notes indicate Layer 2 directory does not exist. Evaluation will identify this gap; fix may require creating Layer 2 scaffolding or documenting that Layer 2 is optional.
- `research/README.md` — Expected to contain "Layer Mapping" section. Will be verified for section presence and content accuracy.

### Configuration / CI
- `.github/workflows/` — No existing CI jobs for evaluate-sdlc-layers found. No changes required; skill is invoked manually or on-demand. If future automation desired, can add workflow trigger (post-commit validation).

### Agent Instructions
- `plugins/development-harness/skills/work-backlog-item/references/sam-definition.md` — Referenced by skill line 18 and `.claude/docs/sdlc-layers/README.md` line 69. Will verify file exists at correct path.
- `plugins/development-harness/skills/development-harness/references/language-manifest-schema.md` — Referenced in SKILL Check 5 (Integration Points). Will verify for "Inherits from Layer 0" statement and Conventions schema presence.
- `plugins/development-harness/skills/development-harness/references/role-resolution-protocol.md` — Referenced in SKILL Check 5. Will verify for "Layer 0 gates apply before role resolution" statement.
