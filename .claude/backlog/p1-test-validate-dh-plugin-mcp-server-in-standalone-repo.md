## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **test: validate dh plugin mcp server in standalone repo** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

Verify that the bundled backlog MCP server starts correctly when the dh plugin is installed on a project that has no pre-existing backlog_core workspace entry. The .mcp.json uses ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} — this must be validated outside the development repo.

Test steps:
1. Use a separate repo with no .claude/skills/backlog/ and no uv workspace entry for backlog_core
2. Install the dh plugin via /plugin install
3. Verify mcp__backlog__* tools appear in the session
4. Call backlog_list and confirm it returns successfully
