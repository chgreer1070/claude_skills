## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **concurrency cap for parallel task dispatch in implement-feature** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

implement-feature dispatches all ready tasks in parallel with no upper bound. A task plan with 20 ready P1 tasks would spawn 20 concurrent agents simultaneously, exhausting API rate limits and making logs unreadable.

Symphony enforces: `available_slots = max(max_concurrent_agents - running_count, 0)`. Both the global cap and per-state caps can be changed in WORKFLOW.md and take effect at runtime.

**Proposed behaviour:**
- Add `max_concurrent_tasks` setting (default: 5) readable from task file frontmatter or a `plan/config.yaml`.
- implement-feature skill: before dispatching wave N, count currently IN PROGRESS tasks (via `implementation_manager.py status`); dispatch only `max_concurrent_tasks - in_progress_count` tasks in the next wave.
- Optional: per-priority cap (e.g., max 2 P1 tasks at once, unlimited P2).
- Wave loop: after each wave completes, re-query ready tasks and dispatch the next batch within the cap.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- With 10 ready tasks and cap=5, implement-feature dispatches 5, waits for completions, then dispatches remaining 5.
- Cap of 0 or negative is rejected with a clear error.
- Setting is optional; omitting it defaults to current unlimited behaviour for backwards compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Work matches description
- [ ] Plan or implementation complete
