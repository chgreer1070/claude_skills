## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **stall detection for subagent tasks** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

task_status_hook.py writes LastActivity timestamps on every Write/Edit/Bash call during task execution, but nothing reads those timestamps to detect or act on stalled agents.

A stalled agent (one that starts but produces no tool activity for N minutes) currently holds its task IN PROGRESS indefinitely, blocking dependent tasks and consuming a concurrency slot.

**Proposed behaviour:**
- Add a stall-checker script (or extend implementation_manager.py) that queries all IN PROGRESS tasks, computes `now - LastActivity`, and flags any task exceeding a configurable threshold (default: 10 min).
- Flagged tasks: update status to BLOCKED with a note `stall detected after Nm of no activity`; delete the active-task context file.
- Hook integration: run the stall checker as a SubagentStop or periodic check within implement-feature before dispatching the next wave of ready tasks.
- Configurable via task file metadata or CLAUDE.md: `stall_timeout_minutes`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- IN PROGRESS task with LastActivity older than threshold is detected and marked BLOCKED automatically.
- implement-feature does not re-dispatch a stalled task without explicit operator action (rerun or manual status reset).
- Stall events are logged with task ID, last activity time, and elapsed minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Work matches description
- [ ] Plan or implementation complete
