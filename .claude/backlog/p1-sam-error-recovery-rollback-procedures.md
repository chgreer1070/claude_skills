## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **sam: error recovery / rollback procedures** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

Define explicit procedure when a task fails irrecoverably. How to undo artifact changes? How to restore artifact plane to consistent state after failure?

## Suggested Location

[`stateless-software-engineering-framework.md`](https://github.com/bitflight-devops/stateless-agent-methodology/blob/main/stateless-software-engineering-framework.md) (new Appendix or Part 6 addition)

## Context

- **Source**: Gap analysis of SAM framework
- **Priority**: P1
- **Added**: 2026-02-01
- **Research questions**: How do GSD, BMAD-METHOD, AutoGPT, and traditional CI/CD handle rollback? What patterns exist for transactional artifact updates?

## Plan
