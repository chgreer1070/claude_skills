## Story

As a **maintainer of the codebase**, I want to **add lifespan management to backlog_core for github client initialization** so that **the code is cleaner and more maintainable**.

## Description

backlog_core has no lifespan management. The GitHub client (`get_github()`) is instantiated per-call, which means token validation and connection setup are repeated on every tool invocation. Under load, this creates redundant API handshakes.

FastMCP v3 provides a `@lifespan` decorator that runs setup once at server start and yields a context dict available via `ctx.lifespan_context`. This is the correct place to validate `GITHUB_TOKEN`, create the GitHub client, and fail fast if credentials are missing.

Files affected: `.claude/skills/backlog/backlog_core/server.py`, `.claude/skills/backlog/backlog_core/github.py`

Work required:
- Define a `@lifespan` that initializes the GitHub client and validates `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Pass the `FastMCP` instance `lifespan=app_lifespan`
- Tools that use GitHub access `ctx.lifespan_context["github"]` instead of calling `get_github()` per-request
- `GitHubUnavailableError` surfaces at startup rather than first GitHub call

Source: FastMCP v3 docs `servers/lifespan.mdx` — `@lifespan` yields a dict into `ctx.lifespan_context`; compose multiple lifespans with `|` operator.
