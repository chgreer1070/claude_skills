## Description

The backlog MCP server (backlog_core/) uses PyGitHub REST API for milestones, issues, PRs, and most operations. Only label lookups (commits 32e5597c, 7280a8ff) and Projects V2 operations use GraphQL. PR #455 (github-graphql-migration branch) only migrated daily-releases scripts, not the backlog server.

## Operations still on REST (PyGitHub)

- `repository.get_milestones()`
- `repository.get_issues()`
- Issue creation, editing, commenting
- PR listing
- Label CRUD (partially — lookup migrated, CRUD not verified)
