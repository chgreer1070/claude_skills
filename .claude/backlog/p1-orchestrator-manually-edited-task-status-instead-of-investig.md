name: Orchestrator manually edited task status instead of investigating hook failure
description: "During #338 implementation, the orchestrator found Task 1.1 still IN PROGRESS after the sub-agent completed. Instead of investigating why the SubagentStop hook didn't update the status (checking hook logs, active-task context file, hook script expectations), the orchestrator directly edited the task plan file with a guessed timestamp. This violates: (1) orchestrator must not edit implementation files, (2) status updates go through task_status_hook.py, (3) unexpected behavior requires investigation not workaround. The flawed reasoning was 'the agent was spawned via Agent tool, not via the Skill tool with start-task' — but skills don't spawn agents; the Skill() call inside the Agent loads instructions, the hook fires on AgentStop regardless. Root cause of the hook not updating status needs investigation."

## Story

As a **developer relying on this plugin**, I want to **orchestrator manually edited task status instead of investigating hook failure** so that **the tool works correctly and reliably**.

## Description

During #338 implementation, the orchestrator found Task 1.1 still IN PROGRESS after the sub-agent completed. Instead of investigating why the SubagentStop hook didn't update the status (checking hook logs, active-task context file, hook script expectations), the orchestrator directly edited the task plan file with a guessed timestamp. This violates: (1) orchestrator must not edit implementation files, (2) status updates go through task_status_hook.py, (3) unexpected behavior requires investigation not workaround. The flawed reasoning was 'the agent was spawned via Agent tool, not via the Skill tool with start-task' — but skills don't spawn agents; the Skill() call inside the Agent loads instructions, the hook fires on AgentStop regardless. Root cause of the hook not updating status needs investigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
