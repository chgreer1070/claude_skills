## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **extend orchestrator-discipline plugin to gate edit/write on skill content files** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

The orchestrator-discipline plugin's PreToolUse hooks currently exclude .md files from the source file read warning, allowing the orchestrator to freely read and edit SKILL.md and references/*.md files. This creates a gap where the orchestrator bypasses delegation to /skill-creator or content optimizer agents for skill content modifications.

Observed failure (session 2026-03-07): Orchestrator directly edited 4 skill reference files (back-links, cross-links, section merges, file moves) instead of delegating to agents. The hooks did not fire because .md files are in the exclusion list.

Needed: A new PreToolUse hook on Edit/Write that fires when the target path matches */skills/*/SKILL.md or */skills/*/references/*.md. The hook should inject additionalContext reminding the orchestrator to delegate skill content changes to /plugin-creator:skill-creator or contextual-ai-documentation-optimizer agents. Reading these files for routing decisions should remain allowed — only Edit/Write should be gated.
