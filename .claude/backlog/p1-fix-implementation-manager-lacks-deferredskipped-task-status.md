name: 'fix: Implementation Manager lacks DEFERRED/SKIPPED task status — blocks auto-completion of task plans with intentionally deferred tasks'
description: "The implementation_manager.py TaskStatus enum only has 3 values: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE. When a task is intentionally deferred (e.g., [DEFERRED] in title, status: not-started), the automation treats it as an incomplete task. This prevents /complete-implementation from triggering because the status check sees remaining NOT_STARTED tasks. Observed on issue #367 where 3/3 non-deferred tasks were COMPLETE but the deferred task kept the issue open. Need to add DEFERRED (and possibly SKIPPED, WONTFIX) as valid terminal statuses that count as 'done' for completion gating. Affected files: plugins/python3-development/skills/implementation-manager/scripts/implementation_manager.py (TaskStatus enum, status parsing, ready-tasks logic, completion check), plugins/python3-development/skills/implementation-manager/scripts/task_format.py (YAML format support)."
