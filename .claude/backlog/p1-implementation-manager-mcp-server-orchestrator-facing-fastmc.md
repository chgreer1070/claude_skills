## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **implementation manager mcp server — orchestrator-facing fastmcp server wrapping sam task file operations** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

Build a FastMCP server that exposes SAM task file operations as MCP tools for the orchestrator. Replaces manual CLI invocations, raw file edits, and JSON wrangling with atomic, validated tool calls.

## Problem
The orchestrator currently manages SAM task files through a combination of:
- CLI calls to implementation_manager.py (read-only, single-feature-scoped)
- Manual Edit/Read tool calls on markdown/YAML task files (error-prone, no state machine)
- Manual JSON writes for context files (3 separate operations that can partially fail)
- Zero tracking of delegated subagent work (delegation black hole)

The SubagentStop hook regex bug (fixed in #337) is a symptom: the hook is the sole completion-marking mechanism because no explicit tool exists.

## Proposed MCP Tools

### Core Query Tools (replace CLI + Read gymnastics)
- **task_dashboard** — Cross-feature overview: all features, task counts, blockers, in-progress items. Today queries are one-slug-at-a-time with no bird's-eye view.
- **task_view** — Single task full detail: acceptance criteria, agent, skills, dependencies, timestamps, notes. Today requires Read of whole file + manual scanning.
- **task_ready** — Ready tasks for a feature (deps satisfied, not started). Exists as CLI but requires uv run + JSON parse.
- **task_dependency_graph** — Which tasks block which, as adjacency list or rendered text. Today mentally reconstructed from Dependencies fields.

### Status Mutation Tools (replace manual Edit calls)
- **task_transition** — Atomic status change with state machine validation (e.g. can't go COMPLETE→NOT STARTED). Today raw markdown/YAML edits with no enforcement.
- **task_block** — Mark BLOCKED with a reason string, record who/what blocked it. Today edit status + manually add note, reason often lost.
- **task_unblock** — Clear BLOCKED state, reset to NOT STARTED or IN PROGRESS. No tooling exists.
- **task_add_note** — Append timestamped implementation note to a task. Context lost between sessions; notes in task file would persist.

### Context & Session Tools (replace manual JSON wrangling)
- **task_claim** — Set active task for session: writes context file, sets IN PROGRESS, adds Started timestamp — one call instead of three. Today 3 separate operations that can partially fail.
- **task_release** — Inverse of claim: marks COMPLETE, adds Completed timestamp, deletes context file. Hook does this but fragile — explicit tool is reliable fallback.
- **task_active** — What tasks are currently claimed across all sessions. Today get_task_context.py finds one file with no multi-session awareness.

### Delegation Tracking (doesn't exist at all today)
- **task_log_delegation** — Record: task X delegated to agent Y at time Z with session_id W. Zero tracking today — task disappears until hook fires or doesn't.
- **task_log_result** — Record subagent outcome: success/failure, summary, files changed. Subagent returns text that vanishes at next compaction.
- **task_active_agents** — Which tasks have live subagents right now. No way to know if a background agent is still running or died silently.

### Workflow Intelligence
- **task_next** — Recommend what to work on: considers dependencies, priority, complexity, what's in progress. Today run ready-tasks, mentally sort, check what's in flight — repetitive every loop.
- **task_validate** — Structure/frontmatter validation (exists as CLI, needs MCP wrapping).
- **task_create** — Add follow-up task to existing feature, auto-wired with dependencies. Today manually write markdown matching format.

### Explicit exclusions
- No subagent output tailing (Agent tool already returns results)
- No task deletion (too destructive for autonomous use; use BLOCKED instead)
- No auto-scheduling/prioritization (orchestrator logic, not data layer)

## Implementation Notes
- Build with FastMCP 2.x Python framework
- Reuse existing task_format.py and implementation_manager.py as the data layer
- State machine for task_transition: NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE, any → BLOCKED, BLOCKED → NOT_STARTED/IN_PROGRESS
- All tools return structured JSON matching existing CLI output conventions
- MCP server config goes in .claude/settings.json or plugin manifest
