## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **add elicitation to backlog_close and backlog_resolve for confirmation of destructive operations** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

`backlog_close` and `backlog_resolve` permanently close GitHub issues and optionally delete local files. These operations are irreversible. Currently they execute immediately upon invocation — there is no confirmation step.

FastMCP v3 provides `ctx.elicit()` for server-side mid-execution user prompts. This allows a tool to pause and ask "Are you sure?" before committing a destructive action. The client renders the confirmation UI; the tool resumes only on `accept`.

Files affected: `.claude/skills/backlog/backlog_core/server.py`

Work required:
- Add `ctx: Context` to backlog_close and backlog_resolve
- Before executing the irreversible GitHub close call, `await ctx.elicit("Close #{issue}: {title}?", response_type=None)`
- On `decline` or `cancel`, return early with a safe message
- Gate this behind a parameter `confirm: bool = True` so automated callers (CI, scripts) can skip elicitation

Note: elicitation requires the client to implement an elicitation handler. Tools must handle the case where the client does not support it.

Source: FastMCP v3 docs `servers/elicitation.mdx` — `ctx.elicit(message, response_type=None)` is approval-only elicitation.
