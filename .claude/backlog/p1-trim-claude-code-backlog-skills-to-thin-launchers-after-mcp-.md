## Story

As a **maintainer of the codebase**, I want to **trim claude code backlog skills to thin launchers after mcp prompt consolidation** so that **the code is cleaner and more maintainable**.

## Description

Depends on #473 (MCP prompts + guided tools in backlog_core).

Once the server has prompts and guided tools, the Claude Code skills become thin launchers. Each skill's workflow instructions are replaced by a prompts/get call to the server.

Changes per skill:
- /backlog → DELETE the skill entirely; backlog_guide() prompt is the replacement. Update CLAUDE.md reference to point to the MCP prompt.
- /create-backlog-item → Reduce to ~10 lines: fetch create_item_guided prompt, call backlog_add_guided tool, report result. Remove all field collection logic, duplicate detection prose, and step-by-step instructions (those now live in the server prompt).
- /groom-backlog-item → Keep orchestration only (fact-check, RT-ICA, agent spawning). Remove item loading steps 1-3 — replace with: fetch groom_item(selector) prompt which returns item state. Remove step 9 write instructions — already documented in the prompt.
- /work-backlog-item → Keep orchestration only (RT-ICA gate, SAM invocation, sub-agent routing). Remove item loading steps 1-2 — replace with: fetch work_item(selector) prompt. Remove close/resolve step 9 — replace with: call backlog_close_confirmed or backlog_resolve_confirmed tools.

Success criteria: each trimmed skill is under 50 lines. All workflow intelligence has a single home in the MCP server.
