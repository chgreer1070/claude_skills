name: Background agent result deduplication after compaction
description: Background agents launched in session N may complete after context compaction or session restart. The system delivers their results as `<task-notification>` messages, but there is no mechanism to mark results as already consumed. During the kaizen build, 3 review agents (plugin-validator, 2x skill-reviewer) completed during Phase 6 and their findings were applied in commit `0d61480`. After compaction, all 3 re-delivered their notifications in session 3, requiring manual evaluation each time ("was this already handled?"). A persistent state file (e.g., `.planning/kaizen/agent-results.json` tracking task IDs → consumed/pending) would eliminate this waste.

## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **background agent result deduplication after compaction** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

Background agents launched in session N may complete after context compaction or session restart. The system delivers their results as `<task-notification>` messages, but there is no mechanism to mark results as already consumed. During the kaizen build, 3 review agents (plugin-validator, 2x skill-reviewer) completed during Phase 6 and their findings were applied in commit `0d61480`. After compaction, all 3 re-delivered their notifications in session 3, requiring manual evaluation each time ("was this already handled?"). A persistent state file (e.g., `.planning/kaizen/agent-results.json` tracking task IDs → consumed/pending) would eliminate this waste.
