name: Structured session work logs with pre-compact and session-start hooks
description: 'The @logging agent exists (.claude/agents/logging.md) and knows how to read transcripts and produce structured work logs (Completed/Decisions/Discovered/Next Steps). But there is no automation to invoke it at the right moments. Three pieces needed: (1) A pre-compact hook that fires the logging agent to snapshot current work into a structured log file before context is lost during compression. (2) A committed log file convention (e.g., .claude/sessions/{date}-{slug}.md) so logs survive across sessions and compressions. (3) A session-start hook that reads the most recent log file and injects it as context so the new session knows what happened. The @logging agent becomes the producer, and the /session-historian skill becomes the consumer that can also search historical logs. Related: backlog item #109 (SAM Audit Trail / Observability) covers broader telemetry — this item is specifically about the agent-facing work log continuity problem.'
