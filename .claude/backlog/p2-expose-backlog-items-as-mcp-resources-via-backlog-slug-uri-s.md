## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **expose backlog items as mcp resources via backlog://{slug} uri scheme** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

Individual backlog items are currently only accessible by calling backlog_view (a tool). MCP resources provide a read path that is separate from tools — clients can browse/read without consuming a tool call slot or triggering side effects.

Expose each per-item file as a backlog://{slug} resource using @mcp.resource("backlog://{slug}"). This gives clients (including Claude Code) direct access to item bodies without going through the tool layer.

Files affected: .claude/skills/backlog/backlog_core/server.py

Changes required:
1. Add @mcp.resource("backlog://{slug}") handler that reads the per-item file and returns its body as text
2. Add @mcp.resource("backlog://") list handler returning all item slugs

This is additive — no existing tools change.
