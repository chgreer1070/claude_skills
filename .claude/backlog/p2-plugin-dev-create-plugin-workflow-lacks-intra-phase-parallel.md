description: The 8-phase create-plugin workflow treats each phase as a serial step, but Phase 5 (Implementation) actually consisted of 6 parallel sub-tasks and Phase 6 (Validation) spawned 3 parallel review agents. The workflow provides no structure for tracking parallel work within a phase — no task dependencies, no completion gates, no way to know which sub-tasks are done after compaction. Batching validation fixes by file rather than by finding would also have been more efficient (SKILL.md was edited 3 separate times when one pass would have sufficed).

## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **`/plugin-dev:create-plugin` workflow lacks intra-phase parallelism tracking** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

The 8-phase create-plugin workflow treats each phase as a serial step, but Phase 5 (Implementation) actually consisted of 6 parallel sub-tasks and Phase 6 (Validation) spawned 3 parallel review agents. The workflow provides no structure for tracking parallel work within a phase — no task dependencies, no completion gates, no way to know which sub-tasks are done after compaction. Batching validation fixes by file rather than by finding would also have been more efficient (SKILL.md was edited 3 separate times when one pass would have sufficed).
