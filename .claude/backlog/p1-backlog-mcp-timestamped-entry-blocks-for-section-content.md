name: 'Backlog MCP: Timestamped entry blocks for section content'
description: "When agents add or update sections on backlog items via backlog_update/backlog_groom (section + content parameters), there is no record of when each piece of content was written. Multiple updates to the same section silently replace previous content with no audit trail.\n\nThe backend should wrap section content in timestamped, addressable blocks using the format:\n```html\n<div><sub>2026-03-10T22:18:04Z</sub>\n\nContent here with **markdown** support.\n</div>\n```\n\nKey behaviors:\n- section + content (no entry_id): appends a new timestamped block to the section\n- entry_id provided: overwrites or removes that specific block. entry_id alone (no section) works if the ID is unique across the issue\n- Legacy content without div/sub wrappers gets assigned entry_id derived from item added date (e.g. 2026-03-09T00:00:00Z) on first new append\n- Parse: regex on `<div><sub>([^<]+)</sub>` extracts entry IDs\n- backlog_view response includes num_entries per section and entry metadata (id, preview)\n- Pagination operates on block/entry count, not line count\n- New tool: backlog_remove_entry(selector, entry_id) for explicit deletion\n\nAffected tools: backlog_update, backlog_groom, backlog_view. Possibly backlog_pull (merge logic needs to respect entry blocks)."

## Groomed (2026-03-11)

### Decision

### Entry Block Format (user, 2026-03-10)

Each content entry in a section is wrapped in a timestamped, addressable block:

```html
<div><sub>{ISO-8601-UTC-timestamp}</sub>

Markdown content here.
</div>
```

- `<sub>` is both the visible timestamp and the parseable entry ID — single element, no duplication
- `<div>` is the block wrapper — handles multi-paragraph content, code blocks, lists
- ISO 8601 strings sort lexicographically — natural chronological ordering
- Entry IDs are unique across the entire issue body

### API Design (user, 2026-03-10)

**Parameters added to backlog_update and backlog_groom:**
- `entry_id` (optional): target a specific block for overwrite. If unique across the issue, `section` is not required.

**Behavior matrix:**
- `section` + `content` (no entry_id) → append new timestamped block to section
- `section` + `content` + `entry_id` → overwrite that specific block within the section
- `entry_id` + `content` (no section) → overwrite block by ID anywhere in the issue (if unique)
- `entry_id` alone (no content) → reserved for future remove operation

**New tool:**
- `backlog_remove_entry(selector, entry_id)` — explicit entry deletion

**backlog_view enhancements:**
- Response includes `num_entries` per section
- Entry metadata: `id`, `preview` (first ~80 chars)
- Pagination operates on entry/block count, not line count

### Legacy Content Migration (user, 2026-03-10)

Existing section content without `<div><sub>` wrappers is not migrated proactively. On first new append to a section containing legacy content:
1. Wrap existing content in `<div><sub>{added_date}T00:00:00Z</sub>` (derived from item's `added` metadata field)
2. Append the new entry with current timestamp
3. Legacy entries become addressable via their assigned ID

### Affected Components (user, 2026-03-10)

- `backlog_update` — section+content write path
- `backlog_groom` — section+content write path
- `backlog_view` — response shape adds entry metadata
- `backlog_pull` — merge logic must respect entry block boundaries
- `operations.py` — new entry block parser/writer utilities
- `parsing.py` — regex patterns for `<div><sub>([^<]+)</sub>`

### Decision

### Struck Entry Format (user, 2026-03-10)

Entries are never deleted. They are struck through with a reason and collapsed:

```html
<div><sub>2026-03-10T22:18:04Z</sub>
<details><summary>struck: 2026-03-11T09:00:00Z — reason text here</summary>

Original content preserved.
</details>
</div>
```

Active vs struck determined by presence of `<details><summary>struck:` — no extra metadata field.

### groomed_content Deprecated (user, 2026-03-10)

`groomed_content` parameter removed from both `backlog_update` and `backlog_groom`. All writes go through entry blocks — no escape hatch that bypasses the system. Full section replacement uses `replace_section=True` which strikes all existing entries with a reason, then appends new content as a single timestamped block.

### parse_entries Interface (user, 2026-03-10)

```text
parse_entries(section_body, show="all", since=None, added_date="0000-00-00")
```

`show` accepts: `"all"`, `"last"`, `"first"`, `"struck"`, positive int (first N from span), negative int (last N from span).

`since` filters span start — only entries at or after that datetime considered before `show` applied.

Example: `parse_entries(body, show=-3, since="2026-03-10")` → 3 most recent active entries since March 10th.

### Duplicate Timestamp Handling (user, 2026-03-10)

Write time: always use bare ISO timestamp, no pre-check. Parse time: if duplicates found, assign `-0`, `-1` suffixes in document order. Caller targets specific one via suffixed form.

### Entry-Aware Merge in backlog_pull (user, 2026-03-10)

Merge rules: entry only on one side → keep. Both sides one struck → keep struck. Both active → keep longer. Both struck → keep later struck timestamp.

Diff output: git-diff style with full entry content (no truncation). `dry_run=True` returns diff without writing. `diff=True` applies merge and returns diff.

### Pagination Change (user, 2026-03-10)

`offset`/`limit` in `backlog_view` replaced with entry-based pagination. Breaking change — clean break, no backward compatibility.

## RT-ICA
