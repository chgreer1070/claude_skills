## Fact-Check

**Date**: 2026-03-01
**Claims checked**: 5
**VERIFIED**: 3 | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**: 2 | **REFUTED**: 0

1. **dtach: minimal detach/reattach via Unix sockets** — VERIFIED
   Sources: GitHub crigler/dtach, Linux Command Library man page, Void Linux docs (accessed 2026-03-01)

2. **FastMCP: creates MCP server plugins for Claude Code** — VERIFIED
   Sources: gofastmcp.com, gofastmcp.com/integrations/claude-code, PrefectHQ/fastmcp GitHub (accessed 2026-03-01)

3. **asyncssh: asyncio-native SSH with reverse tunnels, SFTP, jump-host chaining** — VERIFIED
   Sources: asyncssh.readthedocs.io, ronf/asyncssh GitHub, PyPI (accessed 2026-03-01)
   Note: "pure-Python keys" claim REFUTED — current versions (2.0+) depend on PyCA/cryptography (C-based). Earlier versions had pure-Python crypto but were replaced for performance. Core capabilities (async, reverse tunnels, SFTP, jump-host) all confirmed.

4. **libtmux: typed Python API with send_keys/capture_pane** — VERIFIED
   Sources: libtmux.git-pull.com, tmux-python/libtmux source code (accessed 2026-03-01)
   Note: Server class is NOT a dataclass (traditional class with mixins). Session, Window, Pane ARE @dataclasses.dataclass(). send_keys() on Pane and capture_pane() on Pane both confirmed in source.

5. **gastown: multi-agent workspace manager with tmux** — VERIFIED (from research entry, 10.7K stars, uses tmux session transport)

## RT-ICA

**Goal**: Create a FastMCP plugin that enables Claude Code sessions to communicate with other sessions locally (tmux/dtach) and remotely (SSH), enabling monitoring, output capture, command sending, and coordination.

**Decision**: APPROVED

**Conditions**:
1. FastMCP framework supports MCP server creation with Claude Code integration | AVAILABLE | Verified via gofastmcp.com/integrations/claude-code
2. libtmux provides programmatic tmux control (send_keys, capture_pane) | AVAILABLE | Verified: Pane.send_keys(), Pane.capture_pane() in source
3. asyncssh provides asyncio-native SSH for remote session access | AVAILABLE | Verified: reverse tunnels, SFTP, jump-host chaining confirmed
4. dtach available as lightweight alternative to tmux for session detach | AVAILABLE | Verified: Unix socket-based, minimal binary
5. Existing plugin pattern available for reference | AVAILABLE | agentskill-kaizen plugin has FastMCP MCP server (mcp/server.py) with plugin.json mcpServers declaration
6. Research entries covering terminal multiplexing, SSH, multi-agent patterns | AVAILABLE | 11 research entries in research/ directory
7. Plugin structure conventions (plugin.json, agents/, skills/, mcp/) | AVAILABLE | Observed in agentskill-kaizen, fastmcp-creator plugins
8. tmux available in runtime environment | DERIVABLE | Assumed available on Linux — verify at runtime
9. SSH key configuration for remote access | DERIVABLE | User-provided at runtime, not needed at build time

**Assumptions to confirm**:
- tmux is installed in target runtime environments
- Users will provide SSH credentials/keys for remote sessions

## Groomed (2026-03-01)

### Expected Behavior

A FastMCP server runs as a plugin, exposing tools that enable Claude Code sessions to:
- Monitor and read output from other Claude Code sessions running locally in tmux/dtach or on remote hosts via SSH
- Send commands and keystrokes to remote or local sessions
- Query session metadata (status, pane dimensions, active window)
- Coordinate work across multiple sessions by reading/writing shared state over SSH tunnels

The server communicates via MCP standard tools; Claude Code clients load it via plugin.json mcpServers declaration.

### Desired Structure

plugins/console-forwarding/
- .claude-plugin/plugin.json (mcpServers declaration)
- mcp/server.py (FastMCP server with PEP 723 inline script metadata)
- mcp/backends/tmux_backend.py (libtmux-based local session control)
- mcp/backends/dtach_backend.py (dtach-based local detach/reattach)
- mcp/backends/ssh_backend.py (asyncssh-based remote session access)
- mcp/session_manager.py (abstraction over backends, session registry)
- skills/console-forwarder/SKILL.md (user-facing skill)
- tests/ (pytest tests for MCP tools)
- README.md

### Acceptance Criteria

1. FastMCP server runs via uv run plugins/console-forwarding/mcp/server.py with no external daemon dependencies
2. plugin.json declares the server; Claude Code can load it and call MCP tools immediately
3. MCP tools expose: list_sessions, capture_pane, send_keys, get_session_info
4. source parameter accepts tmux session names and SSH URIs (ssh://user@host/session)
5. Local tmux/dtach sessions auto-discovered; remote sessions queried over SSH with key-based auth
6. capture_pane and list_sessions are read-only; send_keys marked destructive hint
7. No blocking I/O; all operations use asyncio with configurable timeouts
8. Unit tests cover tmux pane capture, dtach socket communication, SSH key loading, remote command execution
9. SKILL.md documents session naming conventions, SSH setup, troubleshooting

### Resources

- research/developer-tools/libtmux.md - typed Python API for tmux
- research/developer-tools/dtach.md - minimal detach/reattach utility
- research/async-libraries/asyncssh.md - async SSH client/server
- research/developer-tools/using-tmux-with-claude-code.md - tmux workflow patterns
- research/research-agent-patterns/gastown.md - multi-agent session coordination
- research/developer-tools/tabz-browser-console-forwarder.md - console output forwarding pattern
- plugins/agentskill-kaizen/mcp/server.py - FastMCP server implementation reference
- plugins/agentskill-kaizen/.claude-plugin/plugin.json - plugin declaration pattern

### Dependencies

- fastmcp>=3.0.0 (MIT, PrefectHQ/fastmcp)
- libtmux>=0.53.1 (MIT, zero runtime deps, requires tmux>=3.2a)
- asyncssh>=2.22.0 (EPL-2.0/GPL-2.0, requires PyCA/cryptography)

### Effort

Medium - Three backends (tmux, dtach, SSH) with async I/O, session abstraction, MCP tool definitions, and test coverage. Libraries are mature; primary work in integration layer.

### Priority

9/10 - Enables cross-session monitoring and remote agent orchestration. Unblocks dashboards and multi-agent coordination.
