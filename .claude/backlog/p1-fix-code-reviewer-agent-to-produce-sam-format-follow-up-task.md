name: Fix code-reviewer agent to produce SAM-format follow-up task files with correct filename convention and task key format
description: 'The code-reviewer agent produces follow-up task files that do not conform to SAM filename conventions (expected: plan/tasks-{N}-{slug}-followup-{k}.md) or use the correct task key format. This causes downstream routing failures in /complete-implementation when it attempts to detect and process follow-up files by name pattern, and when backlog-linking logic derives search titles from filenames. Success looks like: code-reviewer follow-up files use the exact SAM filename pattern, task keys within those files match the format expected by sam CLI and task_status_hook.py, and /complete-implementation can detect, route, and attach them to backlog items without manual intervention.'

## Story

As a **developer using Claude Code skills**, I want to **fix code-reviewer agent to produce sam-format follow-up task files with correct filename convention and task key format** so that **the tooling becomes more capable and complete**.

## Description

The code-reviewer agent produces follow-up task files that do not conform to SAM filename conventions (expected: plan/tasks-{N}-{slug}-followup-{k}.md) or use the correct task key format. This causes downstream routing failures in /complete-implementation when it attempts to detect and process follow-up files by name pattern, and when backlog-linking logic derives search titles from filenames. Success looks like: code-reviewer follow-up files use the exact SAM filename pattern, task keys within those files match the format expected by sam CLI and task_status_hook.py, and /complete-implementation can detect, route, and attach them to backlog items without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Work matches description
- [ ] Plan or implementation complete

## Context

- **Source**: Agent task — auto-derived from title
- **Priority**: P1
- **Added**: 2026-03-18
- **Research questions**: None
