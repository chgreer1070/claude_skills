## Groomed (2026-03-20)

### Fact-Check Update

<div><sub>2026-03-20T23:38:51Z</sub>

Fact-checker (2026-03-20) found that existing milestone skills (/create-milestone, /group-items-to-milestone, /start-milestone, /complete-milestone) already use PyGithub scripts as their primary path via github_project_setup.py. The gh CLI is used only as fallback. This item needs re-scoping — the migration claimed in the description is already partially done. Verify each skill individually to determine what remains.
