# Plugin Assessment Report: the-rewrite-room (Post-Refactoring)

## Executive Summary

- **Overall Score**: 88/100 (up from 76/100 baseline)
- **Marketplace Ready**: With Changes (1 critical issue remaining)
- **Critical Issues**: 1
- **Warnings**: 3
- **Recommendations**: 4
- **Files Analyzed**: 22

### Key Findings

- All 3 original critical issues from the baseline assessment are RESOLVED
- 1 new critical issue: `plugin.json` `commands` field declares only 1 of 5 command files, making 4 commands invisible due to auto-discovery override
- skilllint passes cleanly (exit 0, no errors or warnings)
- Well-structured plugin with canonical STATUS block contract, Mermaid routing diagrams, and consistent agent patterns

### Original Critical Issues -- Resolution Status

| Original Issue | Status | Evidence |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| `commands/rwr/doc-to-skill.md` missing | RESOLVED | File exists at `plugins/the-rewrite-room/commands/rwr/doc-to-skill.md` (592 bytes) |
| `the-rewrite-room/workflows/validate.md` dangling reference | RESOLVED | `grep -r "validate\.md"` returns no matches (exit 1) |
| Hardcoded `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/` paths | RESOLVED | `grep -r "/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/"` returns no matches (exit 1) |

## 1. Discovery Summary

| Category | Count | Files |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Skills | 2 | the-rewrite-room, user-docs-to-ai-skill |
| Commands | 5 | audit, author, cite, doc-to-skill, optimize |
| Agents | 5 | rewrite-room-auditor, rewrite-room-author, rewrite-room-cite, rewrite-room-doc-converter, rewrite-room-optimizer |
| Reference Docs | 6 | status-block-contract.md, input-resolution.md, extraction-patterns.md, quality-criteria.md, skill-structure-guide.md, workflow-identification.md |
| Workflow Files | 3 | audit.md, optimize.md, author.md |
| Config Files | 2 | plugin.json, hooks/hooks.json |
| README | 1 | README.md |

**Total Plugin Size**: ~115,037 bytes across 22 markdown files + 2 JSON config files

## 2. Plugin Manifest

**Status**: Incomplete

**File**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

### Issues

- [CRITICAL] `commands` field declares `["./commands/rwr/doc-to-skill.md"]` but 5 command files exist in `commands/rwr/`. Per auto-discovery override rules (documented in claude-plugins-reference-2026 and MEMORY.md incident 2026-03-17), declaring a subset in the `commands` field overrides auto-discovery entirely -- the other 4 commands (audit.md, author.md, cite.md, optimize.md) become invisible to Claude Code. **Fix**: Either list all 5 commands explicitly, or remove the `commands` field entirely to let auto-discovery register all files in `commands/`.

### Manifest Fields Present

| Field | Present | Value |
|-------|---------|-------|
| name | Yes | "rwr" |
| version | Yes | "2.6.0" |
| description | Yes | Comprehensive, includes trigger phrases |
| author | Yes | name + url |
| keywords | Yes | 9 keywords |
| mcpServers | Yes | file-reader |
| commands | Yes | 1 file (SHOULD be all 5 or omitted) |

## 3. Skills Assessment

### Overview

| Skill | Status | Description Quality | Chars | References | Orphans |
|-------|--------|---------------------|-------|------------|---------|
| the-rewrite-room | Pass | 9/10 | 7,760 | 0 direct refs (workflow files referenced inline) | 0 |
| user-docs-to-ai-skill | Pass | 9/10 | 11,141 | 5 linked | 0 |

### the-rewrite-room Details

**Location**: `skills/the-rewrite-room/SKILL.md`

#### Frontmatter

- `name`: "the-rewrite-room" -- valid
- `description`: Comprehensive with trigger phrases and agent references -- 9/10
- `allowed-tools`: "Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Task, Write, Edit" -- valid comma-separated format
- skilllint: PASS (exit 0)

#### Content Quality

- Mermaid workflow index diagram: present and complete
- Command reference table: all 5 commands listed with entry agents
- "Adding New Workflows" section: excellent onboarding documentation with verification checklist
- Source components section: complete with external dependency paths
- No orphaned files

### user-docs-to-ai-skill Details

**Location**: `skills/user-docs-to-ai-skill/SKILL.md`

#### Frontmatter

- `name`: "user-docs-to-ai-skill" -- valid
- `description`: Comprehensive, lists all supported formats -- 9/10
- `allowed-tools`: valid
- `argument-hint`: present and descriptive
- skilllint: PASS (exit 0)

#### Reference File Audit

All 5 reference files are linked from SKILL.md:

| File | Linked From | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| references/input-resolution.md | SKILL.md:73,96,206 | Valid |
| references/extraction-patterns.md | SKILL.md:106,108,207 | Valid |
| references/workflow-identification.md | SKILL.md:124,208 | Valid |
| references/skill-structure-guide.md | SKILL.md:179,185,193,209 | Valid |
| references/quality-criteria.md | SKILL.md:200,210 | Valid |

No orphaned reference files.

## 4. Commands Assessment

All 5 commands follow a consistent pattern: YAML frontmatter with description, argument-hint, agent routing, and allowed-tools.

| Command | Agent | Frontmatter Valid | Description Quality |
|---------|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| audit.md | rewrite-room-auditor | Yes | 8/10 |
| author.md | rewrite-room-author | Yes | 8/10 |
| cite.md | rewrite-room-cite | Yes | 9/10 |
| doc-to-skill.md | rewrite-room-doc-converter | Yes | 8/10 |
| optimize.md | rewrite-room-optimizer | Yes | 8/10 |

### Issues

- [CRITICAL] Only `doc-to-skill.md` is registered in plugin.json `commands` field -- 4 commands invisible (see Section 2)

## 5. Agents Assessment

All 5 agents share consistent structure: YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools, model, color), Mermaid task routing diagram, specialist agent reference table, output contract linking to status-block-contract.md.

| Agent | Model | Tools Valid | Description Quality | Status Block Link |
|-------|-------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| rewrite-room-auditor | sonnet | Yes | 9/10 | Valid |
| rewrite-room-author | sonnet | Yes | 9/10 | Valid |
| rewrite-room-cite | sonnet | Yes | 9/10 | Valid |
| rewrite-room-doc-converter | sonnet | Yes | 8/10 | Valid |
| rewrite-room-optimizer | sonnet | Yes | 9/10 | Valid |

No issues. All agents have valid frontmatter with required `name` field, clear descriptions with trigger phrases, and consistent output contracts.

## 6. Hooks Validation

**File**: `hooks/hooks.json`

- Hook event: `SubagentStop` -- valid event name per hooks-guide
- Hook type: `prompt` -- valid type
- Prompt validates STATUS block contract compliance for rewrite-room agents
- `timeout: 10000` -- reasonable for prompt-based validation
- Agent name filtering logic is correct (checks for "rewrite-room-" prefix)
- No issues found

| **Total** | **100%** | -- | **88/100** |

**Score improvement**: 76 -> 88 (+12 points)

### Scoring Notes

- **Structural validity (90)**: Correct directory structure, all files present, all links valid. Deducted for plugin.json commands field issue.
- **Manifest completeness (70)**: Required fields present but commands field misconfigured. This is the primary drag on the score.
- **Frontmatter correctness (95)**: All skills and agents have valid frontmatter with required fields.
- **Description quality (90)**: Excellent descriptions with trigger phrases across all components.
- **Reference organization (95)**: All reference files linked, no orphans. Template links in examples are clearly documentation.
- **Documentation quality (95)**: README is comprehensive with examples. Workflow files are detailed with Mermaid diagrams.
- **Enhancement potential (70)**: Plugin is mature but external dependencies are not self-contained.

## 9. Action Items

### Critical (Must Fix Before Release)

- [ ] `plugin.json:28-30`: Fix `commands` field -- either list all 5 command files or remove the field entirely to enable auto-discovery. Current state makes 4 of 5 commands invisible.

### Recommended (Should Fix)

- [ ] Consider adding `license` field to plugin.json
- [ ] Add `repository` field to plugin.json for discoverability
- [ ] Verify external plugin dependencies exist at referenced paths (development-harness, plugin-creator, summarizer, gitlab-skill, process-siren) -- these are runtime requirements

### Optional (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Add a Dependencies section to SKILL.md listing required plugins with installation commands
- [ ] Consider whether the `the-rewrite-room/` subdirectory (containing workflows/ and references/) could be moved into the skill directory for better containment
- [ ] The `rewrite-room-cite` agent at 5,699 chars is the largest agent -- consider extracting the workflow steps into a reference file if it grows further
- [ ] Add `homepage` field to plugin.json pointing to README or docs
