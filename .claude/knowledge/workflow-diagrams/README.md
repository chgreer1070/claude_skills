## Coverage Legend

All diagrams use consistent visual encoding:

```text
Coverage Levels:
  ✅ COVERED (green)  - 3+ assets covering this stage
  ⚠️ PARTIAL (yellow) - 1-2 assets covering this stage
  ❌ GAP (red/grey)   - No assets, identified gap
```

## How to Use These Diagrams

1. **New to the system?** Start with [Master Workflow](./master-workflow.md)
2. **Building an extension?** Use [Asset Decision Tree](./asset-decision-tree.md)
3. **Delegating work?** Follow [Multi-Agent Orchestration](./multi-agent-orchestration.md)
4. **Quick task?** Use [Simple Task Workflow](./simple-task-workflow.md)
5. **Debugging/research?** Follow [Investigation Workflow](../../../plugins/scientific-method/shared/investigation-workflow.md)
6. **Need context?** Use [RAG Retrieval Pattern](./rag-retrieval-pattern.md)
7. **Planning improvements?** See [Gap Recommendations](./gap-recommendations.md)

## Maintenance

When adding new skills, agents, commands, or hooks:

1. Update the asset tables in this README
2. Add the asset to relevant workflow diagrams
3. Update coverage assessments if stage coverage changes
4. Review gap recommendations for closure
