# SDLC Layer Separation Architecture

Three-layer architecture separating SDLC-agnostic framework/process from language-specific steps and stack/goal-specific implementations. Each layer builds on the previous layer's best practices, reference documentation, and examples.

## Layer Model

| Layer | Scope | Contents |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Layer 0** | SDLC-Agnostic | SAM pipeline, human touchpoints, artifact conventions, RT-ICA, verification protocol, task format, subagent contract, evidence discipline |
| **Layer 1** | Language-Specific | Language manifest, abstract roles, quality gates, project detection, language standards |
| **Layer 2** | Stack/Goal-Specific | Architecture patterns, toolchain config, reference examples, stack research |
| **ARL Meta-Layer** | Observation (Improvement) | Observe → Identify → Probe → Accumulate → Improve |

## Principles

1. **Layer 0 is the single source of truth** for process, gates, and conventions. Layer 1 and 2 docs reference it; they do not duplicate.
2. **Harness owns process**; language plugins own specialists. The development-harness is the canonical Layer 0 implementation.
3. **Stack profiles are optional**. A project can use Layer 0 + Layer 1 only.

## Evaluation

Use the `evaluate-sdlc-layers` skill to validate and iterate on this implementation: `/evaluate-sdlc-layers [--dry-run | --fix]`

## Experiments & Learnings

Flow experiments run in [sam-flow-experiments](https://github.com/Jamie-BitFlight/sam-flow-experiments). Clone via SSH: `git clone git@github.com:Jamie-BitFlight/sam-flow-experiments.git`. Each experiment tests orchestrations, prompts, and task handoffs against concept fixtures from stateless-agent-methodology. Findings feed back into layer docs, skills, and the ARL Observation Layer.
