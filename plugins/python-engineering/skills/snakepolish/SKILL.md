# Snake Polish — Implementation Phase

Execute the implementation plan from `/python-engineering:stinkysnake`.

## Prerequisites

1. `/python-engineering:stinkysnake` phases 1-5 completed
2. Modernization plan reviewed and refined
3. Failing tests written

## Implementation Order

1. Type definitions (TypeAlias, TypedDict, Protocol)
2. Data structures (dataclass, Pydantic models)
3. Utility functions
4. Core business logic
5. Integration points
6. Entry points

## Iterative Loop

```bash
# After each batch
uv run pytest -v --tb=short

# Final verification
uv run prek run --files $ARGUMENTS
# Fallback when no .pre-commit-config.yaml:
# uv run ruff check $ARGUMENTS
uv run pytest -v --cov --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Completion

When all tests pass and static analysis is clean:

1. Report implementation summary
2. List any deferred items
3. Reference documentation updates needed
