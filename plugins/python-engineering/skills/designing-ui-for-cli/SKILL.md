# CLI UI Design

Before any display or output code is written, the agent runs a 7-stage design discipline rooted in per-project PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md (base design system — colours, tokens, typography, components), and DESIGN.TUI.md (TUI supplement — inherits from DESIGN.md, adds behavioural rules for output channels, symbols, and interaction). When both are present, load both: DESIGN.md provides the palette; DESIGN.TUI.md provides the terminal-specific contract. The skill governs registration, shape brief, implementation, critique, audit, and polish for any Typer, Rich, Textual, or Questionary surface.

## Setup Gates

The agent MUST satisfy each gate before progressing past it. Check order is top-down.

| Gate | Required check | If fail | Hard Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Context | First turn invokes `scripts/load-design-context.py` to load PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.TUI.md, DESIGN.md from project root, `.claude/context/`, or `docs/` | Skip only if context already in conversation history; otherwise run loader | Stage 0 actor |
| Product | PRODUCT.md present, non-empty, no `[TODO]` placeholders, ≥200 chars | Run inline interview using `./references/product-md-schema.md` template, write file with user confirmation, re-run loader, resume original task | PRODUCT.md absence re-entry |
| Shape | Shape brief produced and user-confirmed before any display code is written | Stop. Do not write display code until brief is signed off | Stage 2 sign-off gate |
| Mutation | Any code change to display logic must trace to a confirmed shape brief or recorded follow-up deferral | Reject change. Loop back to Shape | Stage 2 sign-off gate |

## Golden Path — 7 Stages

Stages run in order. Stages 4–6 also act as quality gates on existing UI code when invoked against a target.

| Stage | Trigger | Output | Reference file |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Context | Skill invoked, no PRODUCT/DESIGN context in conversation | JSON from loader, or written PRODUCT.md after interview | `./references/product-md-schema.md`, `./references/design-md-schema.md` |
| 1 — Register | Stage 0 complete, target identified | Bare value `brand-cli` or `product-cli`, recorded against the target | `./references/register-decision.md` |
| 2 — Shape | Register set, Stage 3 not yet started | 10-section shape brief, user-confirmed | `./references/shape-brief-template.md` |
| 3 — Implement | Shape brief confirmed | Display code per the brief | Conditional by library in scope — see Reference Loading Guide §Stage 3 below |
| 4 — Critique | Invoked against any target (any stage) | Two-assessment report: Nielsen /40 score + AI-slop verdict + deterministic detector findings | `./references/critique-checklist.md`, `./references/ai-slop-test.md` |
| 5 — Audit | Invoked against any target | Per-issue P0–P3 severity tags + 5-dimension /20 advisory rating | `./references/audit-checklist.md` |
| 6 — Polish | Audit cleared (no P0); pre-ship check | 22-item checklist with each item checked or explicitly deferred with reason | `./references/polish-checklist.md` |

## Hard Rules

These rules govern stage transitions and gate behaviour. Violations require a recorded deferral.

- **Stage 0 actor** — agent invokes `scripts/load-design-context.py` on the first turn of any UI-touching task. Skip only when PRODUCT.md and DESIGN context are already in conversation history. Loader output JSON is read into context; no further file reads needed.
- **Stage 1 register tie-breaker** — apply the four-step first-match-wins decision rule in `./references/register-decision.md`. Default `product-cli` when nothing matches.
- **Stage 2 sign-off gate** — no display code is written until the shape brief is user-confirmed via AskUserQuestion. A shape run is incomplete until the brief is confirmed. If the user disagrees with any part, return to discovery questions for that part.
- **Stage 4 critique scope** — runs whenever invoked against a target. There is no skip condition for "trivial outputs". After findings, the agent runs AskUserQuestion offering `Top 3 only`, `All issues`, or `Critical only`; recommended actions are filtered by the user's chosen scope.
- **Stage 5 audit hard gate** — any P0 issue blocks ship. Zero P0 issues lets the work pass. Aggregate /20 score remains advisory only — Excellent / Good / Acceptable / Poor / Critical bands do not block. Severity tip: "Would a user contact support about this? If yes, it's at least P1."
- **Stage 6 polish hard gate** — every applicable checklist item must check, OR the unchecked item is explicitly marked "deferred to follow-up" with a recorded reason. No aggregate threshold. Triage rule when polish time is tight: functional issues ship first; cosmetic ones can land in a follow-up.
- **Recovery loop** — when Stage 4 or Stage 5 surfaces issues, the agent applies the per-issue Recommended Actions and re-runs the same gate. There is no "return to Implement" or "return to Shape" transition unless the user requests it.
- **PRODUCT.md absence re-entry** — when PRODUCT.md is missing, empty, or placeholder (`[TODO]` markers, <200 chars), the agent runs an inline interview using `./references/product-md-schema.md` as the question template, writes the file to project root with user confirmation, re-runs `scripts/load-design-context.py`, then resumes the original task. If the original task was Shape or beyond, agent resumes at Shape.
- **Target boundary** — skill activates against a user-supplied or task-named target (file, component, screen, surface). No auto-detection of "UI-touching tasks". The 7-stage workflow runs against the supplied target.

## Reference Loading Guide

Load only the files relevant to libraries in scope and the active stage. Do not pre-load every reference.

### Always loadable when implementing display logic

- `./references/code-quality-patterns.md` — naming, function design, error handling conventions


## Status Indicator Reference

Status indicators must be scannable in under one second using shape, colour, and position — no reading required. This table is the canonical CLI status vocabulary; every implementation aligns with it unless DESIGN.TUI.md overrides explicitly.

| State | Symbol | Rich colour | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Running | `⠸` (spinner) | `cyan` | Animated while active |
| Success | `✓` | `green` | Always leftmost in row |
| Warning | `!` | `yellow` | Same position as success |
| Error | `✗` | `red` | Same position as success |
| Skipped | `–` | `dim` | Visually quieter than success |

- Shape alone (not just colour) must distinguish states — colour-blind safe
- Position consistent: status symbol always in column 0 of a row (the Status Column Rule)
- No reading required: the pattern is scannable before comprehension kicks in
