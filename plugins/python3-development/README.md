# Python Development

Teaches Claude modern Python 3.11+ patterns and your preferred workflows.

## Why Install This?

When you ask Claude to write Python code, Claude sometimes:

- Uses outdated syntax (old typing patterns, Python 3.8 style)
- Picks random libraries instead of ones that work well together
- Creates inconsistent project structures across different projects
- Immediately fixes tests to make them pass without investigating why they failed
- Doesn't follow conventions you use in your existing projects
- Jumps into implementation without proper planning

## What Changes

With this plugin installed, Claude will:

- **Plan before coding**: Every task starts with discovery and planning phases
- **Write modern Python 3.11+**: Native generics, union types with `|`, pattern matching
- **Use proven library combinations**: Typer+Rich for CLIs, pytest-mock for testing
- **Follow consistent project structure**: `packages/` directory, hatchling build system
- **Investigate test failures**: Balanced approach considers both test bugs and implementation bugs
- **Apply quality workflows**: Linting, formatting, type checking, and testing
- **Reference 50+ libraries**: Modern Python modules with usage guidance

## Installation

First, add the marketplace (one-time setup):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills
```

Then install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install python3-development@jamie-bitflight-skills
```

## Usage

Just install it - Claude uses it automatically when working with Python code. You'll notice:

- **Task Planning**: Claude gathers context and plans before implementing
- **Modern Code**: Cleaner Python 3.11+ syntax throughout
- **Consistent Structure**: `packages/` layout, proper typing
- **Better Testing**: pytest-mock, hypothesis, mutation testing for critical code
- **Quality Gates**: Linting, formatting, and type checking integrated

## Example

**Without this plugin**: You say "build a CLI tool to process CSV files". Claude creates it with argparse, prints plain text, uses `List[str]` syntax, puts code in `src/`, and when a test fails, immediately changes the test to match the implementation.

**With this plugin**: Same request, but Claude first gathers context and plans the approach. Then it uses Typer+Rich (progress bars, formatted tables), writes `list[str]` with native generics, puts code in `packages/csv_tool/`, includes comprehensive type hints, and when a test fails, investigates whether the test caught a real bug before deciding what to fix.

## Requirements

- Claude Code v2.0+
