# Python 3 Development

Modern Python 3.11+ development workflows with CLI apps, testing patterns, code quality tools, and TDD best practices.


## Why Install This?

When you ask Claude to write Python code without this plugin, you might notice:

- Outdated syntax patterns from Python 3.8 or earlier
- Random library choices instead of proven combinations
- Inconsistent project structures across different files
- Tests that get immediately "fixed" to pass instead of being investigated
- Missing modern type hints and pattern matching
- Implementation that starts before understanding requirements

With this plugin, Claude applies consistent Python 3.11+ standards and routes to specialist skills automatically.

## What You Get

With this plugin installed, Claude will:

- **Plan before coding**: Discovery and analysis phases before implementation
- **Write modern Python 3.11+**: Native generics (`list[str]`), union types (`str | None`), pattern matching
- **Use proven libraries**: Typer + Rich for CLIs, pytest-mock for testing, httpx for HTTP, pydantic for validation
- **Follow consistent structure**: `pyproject.toml` with Hatchling, `uv` for dependency management
- **Investigate test failures**: Balanced approach that considers both test issues and real bugs
- **Apply quality workflows**: Integrated ruff linting, ty type checking, and pytest

|---------|---------|
| `/python3-development:python3-bug "feature X not working"` | Debug functional issues with logs and specs |

## Automatic Behaviors

Once installed, Claude automatically applies these patterns when working with Python code:

**Modern Python Syntax:**

- Uses `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`
- Applies `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`
- Leverages pattern matching for complex conditionals
- Implements proper `async/await` patterns for I/O-bound work

**Library Defaults:**

- CLI apps: Typer + Rich
- HTTP clients: httpx
- Configuration: pydantic-settings
- Testing: pytest + pytest-mock + hypothesis

**Tooling Defaults:**

- `uv` for dependency management
- `ruff` for linting and formatting
- `ty` for type checking (switches to `mypy` if the project already uses it)
- Hatchling build backend
- PEP 723 inline metadata for standalone scripts

## Specialized Skills

## Agents in This Plugin

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `python-cli-architect` | Implements Python CLI features (Typer/Rich) |
| `python-cli-design-spec` | Produces architecture specs for Python CLIs |
| `python-pytest-architect` | Writes pytest test suites |
| `code-reviewer` | Code review with Python quality and idiom awareness |
| `semantic-code-search` | Searches codebase by behavior, not just keywords |

## Shared Workflow Agents (development-harness)

Language-agnostic planning and verification agents are in the `development-harness` plugin. Use `@dh:` prefix:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `@dh:feature-researcher` | Research features, produce discovery context |
| `@dh:codebase-analyzer` | Explore patterns, write structured analysis |
| `@dh:context-gathering` | Gather context for implementation |
| `@dh:plan-validator` | Validate implementation plans |
| `@dh:feature-verifier` | Goal-backward verification after implementation |
| `@dh:swarm-task-planner` | Decompose features into structured task plans |

## Example

**Without this plugin:**

You say: "Build a CLI tool to process CSV files"

Claude creates `argparse`-based CLI with `List[str]` syntax, puts code in `src/`, and immediately modifies tests to pass.

**With this plugin:**

Claude:

1. Checks existing project structure and dependencies
2. Implements with Typer + Rich, using `list[str]` and `str | None` native syntax
3. Writes pytest tests before implementation
4. When a test fails, analyzes whether it is a test bug or a real bug before deciding what to change

## Installation

First, add the marketplace (one-time setup):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills
```

Then install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install python3-development@jamie-bitflight-skills
```

## Relationship to python-engineering

This plugin and `python-engineering` share 25 skills. Each also has unique skills the other does not:

**Only in `python3-development`** (10 skills):
`stdlib-scripting`, `semantic-code-search`, `python-cli-architect`, `rich`, `python3-bug`, `python3-review`, `implementation-manager`, `use-command-template`, `python3-development-meta-docs`, `python3-development`

**Only in `python-engineering`** (18 skills):
`python3-core`, `python3-typing`, `python3-tdd`, `python3-testing`, `python3-tools`, `python3-cli`, `python3-web`, `python3-data`, `python3-stdlib-only`, `debug`, `lint`, `review`, `cleanup`, `designing-ui-for-cli`, `orchestrating-python-development`, `python-cross-platform-smoothing`, `standards-for-python-development`, `python3-stdlib-only`

Install both plugins for full coverage. `stdlib-scripting` — which provides Claude with stdlib-only scripting patterns — is only available in this plugin.

## Requirements

- Claude Code v2.0+
- Python 3.11+ recommended
