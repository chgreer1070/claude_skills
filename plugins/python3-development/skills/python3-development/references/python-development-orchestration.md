# Python Development Orchestration Guide

Comprehensive guide for orchestrating Python development tasks using specialized agents and commands.

**Quick Reference**: For a concise overview and quick-start examples, see [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

## Available Agents and Commands

### Agents (bundled in this plugin)

- **python-cli-architect** — Build modern CLI applications with Typer and Rich (DEFAULT for all Python code)
- **python3-development:stdlib-scripting** — Create stdlib-only portable scripts (LAST RESORT for confirmed restricted environments only)
- **python-pytest-architect** — Design comprehensive test suites
- **python-code-reviewer** — Review Python code for quality and standards
- **python-cli-design-spec** — Design system architecture
- **swarm-task-planner** — Break down tasks into implementation plans

### Commands (in this skill: references/commands/)

- **/python3-development:modernpython** — Apply Python 3.11+ best practices and modern patterns (reference guide, not automated tool)
- **/python3-development:shebangpython** — Validate and correct PEP 723 shebang compliance (edits files directly)

- **/python3-development:uv** — Package management with uv (always use for Python dependency management)

## Delegation Rule

**Context to include in the prompt** means: file paths, outcomes, and user requirements only. Do not pass file contents, summaries, or pre-gathered data — agents discover and read files themselves.

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. TDD Workflow (Test-Driven Development)

**When to use**: Building new features, fixing bugs with test coverage

Prose above the diagram carries detail that would clutter the nodes. Before delegating the Design step, verify whether the user has existing architecture docs — if yes, pass those paths instead of creating new architecture.

Before the Implement step, check whether the deployment environment is restricted (no internet, no uv). If yes, use `python3-development:stdlib-scripting` instead of `python3-development:python-cli-architect`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1["1. Design<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-cli-design-spec<br>Context: user requirements, any existing codebase paths<br>Output: component interfaces, module layout, CLI command tree"]
    S2["2. Write Tests<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-pytest-architect<br>Context: architecture design file path<br>Output: tests/ directory with failing test suite"]
    S3{"3. Implement<br>Default: python3-development:python-cli-architect<br>Restricted env only: python3-development:stdlib-scripting<br>Context: tests/ path, assets/python-cli-demo.py path<br>Output: implementation that makes all tests pass"}
    S4["4. Review<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-code-reviewer<br>Context: implementation file paths, tests/ path<br>Output: review findings with file:line references, improvement suggestions"]
    S5["5. Validate<br>Run: /python3-development:shebangpython on each script<br>Run: Activate holistic-linting skill<br>Run: uv run pytest (verify >80% coverage)<br>Check: CI config for additional validators<br>Pass criteria: all tests green, linting clean, coverage threshold met"]
    S1 -->|"Output: component interfaces, module layout, CLI command tree"| S2
    S2 -->|"Output: tests/ with failing test suite"| S3
    S3 -->|"Output: implementation making all tests pass"| S4
    S4 -->|"Output: review findings, improvement list"| S5
```

**Example**:

<example>
User: "Build a CLI tool to process CSV files with progress bars"

1. Task is Design with subagent_type="python3-development:python-cli-design-spec"
   Context to include in the prompt: Design architecture for CSV processing CLI with progress tracking
   Output: Architecture design file with component list, module layout, CLI command tree

2. Task is Write Tests with subagent_type="python3-development:python-pytest-architect"
   Context to include in the prompt: Path to architecture design file from step 1
   Output: tests/ directory with failing test files

3. Task is Implement with subagent_type="python3-development:python-cli-architect"
   Context to include in the prompt: tests/ path; reference implementation at
     plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-development/assets/python-cli-demo.py
   Output: packages/ with implementation that makes all tests pass

4. Task is Review with subagent_type="python3-development:python-code-reviewer"
   Context to include in the prompt: packages/ and tests/ file paths
   Output: Review findings with file:line references and improvement list

5. Validate
   /python3-development:shebangpython packages/csv_processor.py
   Activate holistic-linting skill on packages/ tests/
   uv run pytest — verify all pass, coverage >80%
</example>

### 2. Feature Addition Workflow

**When to use**: Adding new functionality to existing codebase

Before delegating Requirements Gathering, read `git log --oneline -10` and pass the codebase path to the spec-analyst — do not summarize the codebase yourself.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1["1. Requirements Gathering<br>subagent_type=spec-analyst<br>Context: codebase path, user request verbatim<br>Output: requirements doc with acceptance criteria"]
    S2["2. Architecture<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-cli-design-spec<br>Context: requirements doc path, existing codebase path<br>Output: design showing integration points with existing code"]
    S3["3. Implementation Planning<br>subagent_type=python3-development:swarm-task-planner<br>Context: architecture design path, existing test patterns path<br>Output: ordered task list with file targets and acceptance criteria per task"]
    S4{"4. Implement<br>Default: python3-development:python-cli-architect<br>Restricted env only: python3-development:stdlib-scripting<br>Context: task list path, relevant existing file paths<br>Output: new feature implementation in packages/"}
    S5["5. Testing<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-pytest-architect<br>Context: new implementation paths, existing test patterns path<br>Output: tests for new feature + integration tests in tests/"]
    S6["6. Review<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-code-reviewer<br>Context: changed file paths, requirements doc path<br>Output: quality assessment against acceptance criteria, improvement list"]
    S7["7. Validate<br>Run: uv run pytest (verify no regressions, >80% coverage)<br>Run: Activate holistic-linting skill<br>Run: /python3-development:modernpython on changed files<br>Pass criteria: all tests green, no regressions, linting clean"]
    S1 -->|"Output: requirements doc, acceptance criteria"| S2
    S2 -->|"Output: design with integration points"| S3
    S3 -->|"Output: ordered task list with file targets"| S4
    S4 -->|"Output: new feature implementation"| S5
    S5 -->|"Output: tests for new feature + integration tests"| S6
    S6 -->|"Output: quality assessment, improvement list"| S7
```

### 3. Code Review Workflow

**When to use**: Before merging changes, during PR review

The shebangpython step applies only when Python scripts are present. Decision criterion: check whether any `.py` files with a shebang line (`#!/`) exist in the changed set.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1["1. Self-Review<br>Run: /python3-development:modernpython on changed files<br>Check: no legacy typing imports (typing.List, typing.Dict, Optional)<br>Check: modern union syntax (X | Y not Union[X, Y])"]
    S2{"2. Scripts present?<br>Criterion: any .py file has shebang (#!/) line"}
    S2a["Run: /python3-development:shebangpython on each script<br>Pass criteria: PEP 723 compliance verified, shebang corrected if needed"]
    S3["3. Agent Review<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-code-reviewer<br>Context: changed file paths, PR description or task description<br>Output: review findings with file:line references, severity labels (critical/major/minor)"]
    S4{"4. Issues found with severity critical or major?"}
    S4a["Fix Issues<br>Implementation fixes: python3-development:python-cli-architect<br>Test fixes: python3-development:python-pytest-architect<br>Context: review findings doc path, file paths to fix"]
    S5["5. Re-validate<br>Run: Activate holistic-linting skill<br>Run: uv run pytest<br>Pass criteria: all review issues addressed, tests green, linting clean"]
    S1 --> S2
    S2 -->|"Yes — scripts present"| S2a
    S2 -->|"No scripts"| S3
    S2a -->|"PEP 723 compliance verified"| S3
    S3 -->|"Output: review findings with severity labels"| S4
    S4 -->|"Yes — fix required"| S4a
    S4 -->|"No critical/major issues"| S5
    S4a -->|"Output: corrections applied"| S5
```

### 4. Refactoring Workflow

**When to use**: Improving code structure without changing behavior

Decision criterion for "Tests exist?": run `uv run pytest --co -q` — if output lists test items and exit code is 0, tests exist. If exit code is non-zero or output is empty, tests are missing.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1{"Tests exist and pass?<br>Run: uv run pytest --co -q<br>Yes: test items listed, exit 0<br>No: empty output or exit non-zero"}
    S1a["Write Tests First<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-pytest-architect<br>Context: file paths to be refactored, current behavior description<br>Output: tests/ capturing current behavior (all must pass before refactoring)"]
    S2["Refactor<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-cli-architect<br>Context: file paths to refactor, tests/ path<br>Constraint: must not break existing tests — run uv run pytest after each change<br>Output: refactored implementation with same external behavior"]
    S3["Validate<br>Run: uv run pytest (coverage must equal or exceed pre-refactor baseline)<br>Pass criteria: all tests green, coverage maintained or improved"]
    S4["Review<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-code-reviewer<br>Context: refactored file paths, tests/ path<br>Output: confirmation refactoring improved structure, no regressions introduced"]
    S5["Apply Standards<br>Run: /python3-development:modernpython on refactored files<br>Run: Activate holistic-linting skill<br>Pass criteria: linting clean, modern patterns applied"]
    S1 -->|"Tests missing"| S1a
    S1a -->|"Output: passing test suite for current behavior"| S2
    S1 -->|"Tests exist and pass"| S2
    S2 -->|"Output: refactored code"| S3
    S3 -->|"Coverage maintained"| S4
    S4 -->|"Output: quality verification"| S5
```

### 5. Debugging Workflow

**When to use**: Investigating and fixing bugs

The Reproduce Bug step requires the bug description verbatim and any error output or stack trace. Pass these as file paths or inline in the prompt — do not summarize.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1["1. Reproduce Bug<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-pytest-architect<br>Context: bug description verbatim, error output or stack trace, relevant file paths<br>Output: tests/test_<module>.py with failing test that isolates the bug"]
    S2["2. Trace Root Cause<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-code-reviewer<br>Context: failing test path, relevant source file paths<br>Output: root cause identification with file:line reference, not a fix — analysis only"]
    S3{"3. Fix<br>Default: python3-development:python-cli-architect<br>Restricted env only: python3-development:stdlib-scripting<br>Context: root cause analysis path, failing test path, source file paths<br>Output: fix that makes the failing test pass"}
    S4["4. Regression Check<br>Run: uv run pytest (full suite)<br>Pass criteria: bug test passes AND no previously passing tests now fail"]
    S5["5. Review<br>subagent_type=python3-development:python-code-reviewer<br>Context: fixed file paths, test paths<br>Output: confirmation fix addresses root cause (not symptom), no new technical debt introduced"]
    S6["6. Validate<br>Run: /python3-development:modernpython on fixed files<br>Run: Activate holistic-linting skill<br>Pass criteria: linting clean, modern patterns applied"]
    S1 -->|"Output: failing test isolating the bug"| S2
    S2 -->|"Output: root cause with file:line reference"| S3
    S3 -->|"Output: fix making failing test pass"| S4
    S4 -->|"All tests green"| S5
    S5 -->|"Output: fix quality verification"| S6
```

## Agent Selection Guide

### When to Use python-cli-architect

**Use when**:

- **DEFAULT choice for all Python scripts and CLI tools**
- Building command-line applications with rich user interaction
- Need progress bars, tables, colored output
- User-facing CLI tools and automation scripts
- Any script where UX matters (formatted output, progress feedback)
- PEP 723 + uv available (internet access present)

**Characteristics**:

- Uses Typer for CLI framework
- Uses Rich for terminal output
- Focuses on UX and polish
- PEP 723 makes dependencies transparent (single file)
- Better UX than stdlib alternatives
- Works anywhere with Python 3.11+ and internet access

**Complexity Advantage** (IMPORTANT):

- LESS development complexity — libraries handle argument parsing, output formatting, validation
- LESS code to write — Typer CLI boilerplate and Rich formatting come built-in
- Better UX — professional output with minimal effort
- Just as portable — PEP 723 + uv makes single-file scripts with dependencies work seamlessly

**This agent is EASIER to use than stdlib-only approaches. Choose this as the default unless portability restrictions exist.**

**Rich Width Handling**: For Rich Panel/Table width issues in CI/non-TTY environments, see [Typer and Rich CLI Examples](../assets/typer_examples/index.md) for complete solutions including the `get_rendered_width()` helper pattern.

**Example tasks**:

- "Build a CLI tool to manage database backups with progress bars"
- "Create an interactive file browser with color-coded output"
- "Create a script to scan git repositories and show status tree"
- "Build a deployment verification tool with progress bars"

### When to Use python3-development:stdlib-scripting

**LAST RESORT** — only for confirmed restricted environments. Ask user first if unclear.

**Use when**:

- **Restricted environment**: No internet access (airgapped, embedded systems)
- **No uv available**: Locked-down systems where uv cannot be installed
- **Hard stdlib-only requirement**: Explicitly requested by user
- **1% case**: Only when deployment environment truly restricts dependencies

**Activation**: `Skill(command: "python3-development:stdlib-scripting")`

**Characteristics**:

- Stdlib only (argparse, pathlib, subprocess)
- Defensive error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility
- No PEP 723 needed — nothing to declare
- Use PEP 723 ONLY if adding external dependencies later
- Ask deployment environment questions before choosing this skill
- This is the EXCEPTION, not the rule

**Complexity Trade-off** (IMPORTANT):

- MORE development complexity — manual implementation of argument parsing, output formatting, validation, error handling
- MORE code to write — build from scratch what libraries provide tested
- Basic UX — limited formatting capabilities
- Maximum portability — the ONLY reason to choose this: runs anywhere Python exists without network access

**This skill is NOT simpler to use — it requires MORE work to build the same functionality. Choose it ONLY for portability, not for simplicity.**

**Note**: Only activate this skill if deployment environment restrictions are confirmed. With PEP 723 + uv, python-cli-architect is preferred for better UX. ASK: "Will this run without internet access or where uv cannot be installed?" See [PEP 723 Reference](./PEP723.md) for details on when to use inline script metadata.

**Example tasks**:

- "Create a deployment script using only stdlib"
- "Build a config file validator that runs without dependencies"

## Agent Selection Decision Process

### For Scripts and CLI Tools

**Step 1: Default to python-cli-architect**

- Provides better UX (Rich components, progress bars, tables)
- PEP 723 + uv handles dependencies (still single file)
- Works in 99% of scenarios

**Step 2: Only use python3-development:stdlib-scripting if:**

- User explicitly states "stdlib only" requirement
- OR deployment environment is confirmed restricted:
  - No internet access (airgapped network, embedded system)
  - uv cannot be installed (locked-down corporate environment)
  - Security policy forbids external dependencies

**Step 3: When uncertain, ASK:**

1. "Where will this script be deployed?"
2. "Does the environment have internet access?"
3. "Can uv be installed in the target environment?"
4. "Is stdlib-only a hard requirement, or would you prefer better UX?"

**Decision Tree**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q1{"Deployment environment<br>has internet access?"}
    Q2{"uv installable<br>in the environment?"}
    A1["python-cli-architect (default)<br>Single file + PEP 723 + uv<br>transparent dependencies"]
    A2["python-cli-architect (default)<br>uv can cache dependencies<br>for offline use"]
    A3["python3-development:stdlib-scripting<br>(last resort)<br>Truly restricted environment"]
    Q1 -->|"YES"| A1
    Q1 -->|"NO"| Q2
    Q2 -->|"YES"| A2
    Q2 -->|"NO"| A3
```

If answers indicate normal environment: python-cli-architect

If answers indicate restrictions: python3-development:stdlib-scripting

**When in doubt**: Use python-cli-architect. PEP 723 + uv makes single-file scripts with dependencies just as portable as stdlib-only scripts for 99% of deployment scenarios.

### When to Use python-pytest-architect

**Use when**:

- Designing test suites from scratch
- Need comprehensive test coverage strategy
- Implementing advanced testing (property-based, mutation)
- Test architecture decisions

**Characteristics**:

- Modern pytest patterns
- pytest-mock exclusively (never unittest.mock)
- AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Coverage and mutation testing

**Example tasks**:

- "Design test suite for payment processing module"
- "Create property-based tests for data validation"

### When to Use python-code-reviewer

**Use when**:

- Reviewing code for quality, patterns, standards
- Post-implementation validation
- Pre-merge code review
- Identifying improvement opportunities

**Characteristics**:

- Checks against modern Python standards
- Identifies anti-patterns
- Suggests improvements
- Validates against project patterns

**Example tasks**:

- "Review this PR for code quality"
- "Check if implementation follows best practices"

## Command Usage Patterns

### /python3-development:modernpython

**Apply to**: Load as reference guide (optional file path argument for context)

**Use when**:

- As reference guide when writing new code
- Learning modern Python 3.11-3.14 features and patterns
- Understanding official PEPs (585, 604, 695, etc.)
- Identifying legacy patterns to avoid
- Finding modern alternatives for old code

**Note**: This is a reference document to READ, not an automated validation tool.

**Usage**:

```text
/python3-development:modernpython
→ Loads comprehensive reference guide
→ Provides Python 3.11+ pattern examples
→ Includes PEP citations with WebFetch commands
→ Shows legacy patterns to avoid
→ Shows modern alternatives to use
→ Framework-specific guides (Typer, Rich, pytest)
```

**With file path**:

```text
/python3-development:modernpython packages/mymodule.py
→ Loads guide for reference while working on specified file
→ Use guide to manually identify and refactor legacy patterns
```

### /python3-development:shebangpython

**Apply to**: Individual Python scripts

**Use when**:

- Creating new standalone scripts
- Ensuring PEP 723 compliance
- Correcting script configuration

**Pattern**:

```text
/python3-development:shebangpython scripts/deploy.py
→ Analyzes imports to determine dependency type
→ Corrects shebang to match script type (edits file if wrong)
→ Adds PEP 723 metadata if external dependencies detected (edits file)
→ Removes PEP 723 metadata if stdlib-only (edits file)
→ Sets execute bit if needed
→ Provides detailed verification report
```

## Integration with uv Skill

**Always use uv skill for**:

- Package management: `uv add <package>`
- Running scripts: `uv run script.py`
- Running tools: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff`
- Creating projects: `uv init`

**Never use**:

- `pip install` (use `uv add`)
- `python -m pip` (use `uv`)
- `pipenv`, `poetry` (use `uv`)

## Quality Gates

**CRITICAL**: The orchestrator MUST instruct agents to use the holistic-linting skill for all code quality checks.

**Every Python development task must pass**:

1. **Code quality**: Activate holistic-linting skill for linting, formatting, and type checking workflows
2. **Tests**: `uv run pytest` (>80% coverage)
3. **Standards**: `/python3-development:modernpython` for modern patterns
4. **Script compliance**: `/python3-development:shebangpython` for standalone scripts

**For critical code** (payments, auth, security):

- Coverage: >95%
- Mutation testing: `uv run mutmut run`
- Security scan: `uv run bandit -r packages/`

**CI Compatibility**: After local checks pass, verify CI requirements are met by checking CI config files for additional validators.

## Reference Example

**Complete working example (bundled)**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/python3-development/assets/python-cli-demo.py`

This file demonstrates all modern Python CLI patterns:

- PEP 723 inline script metadata with correct shebang
- Typer + Rich integration (Typer includes Rich, don't add separately)
- Modern Python 3.11+ patterns (StrEnum, Protocol, TypeVar, etc.)
- Proper type annotations with Annotated syntax
- Rich components (Console, Progress, Table, Panel)
- Async processing patterns
- Comprehensive docstrings

Use this as the reference implementation when creating CLI tools.

## Examples of Complete Workflows

### Example: Building a CLI Tool

```text
User: "Build a CLI tool to validate YAML configurations"

Orchestrator:
1. Task is Architecture Design with subagent_type="python3-development:python-cli-design-spec"
   Context to include in the prompt: Design architecture for YAML validation CLI
   Output: Architecture file with component list, validation rules, module layout

2. Task is Write Tests with subagent_type="python3-development:python-pytest-architect"
   Context to include in the prompt: Architecture design file path from step 1
   Output: tests/test_validator.py with fixtures (all tests fail initially)

3. Task is Implement with subagent_type="python3-development:python-cli-architect"
   Context to include in the prompt: tests/ file paths; reference at
     plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-development/assets/python-cli-demo.py
   Output: packages/validator.py with Typer+Rich UI — all tests pass

4. Validation:
   /python3-development:shebangpython packages/validator.py
   Activate holistic-linting skill on packages/validator.py tests/
   uv run pytest — verify all pass, coverage >80%

5. Task is Review with subagent_type="python3-development:python-code-reviewer"
   Context to include in the prompt: packages/validator.py and tests/ file paths
   Output: Quality check findings with file:line references

6. Fix any issues and re-validate
```

### Example: Fixing a Bug

```text
User: "Fix bug where CSV parser fails on empty rows"

Orchestrator:
1. Task is Reproduce Bug with subagent_type="python3-development:python-pytest-architect"
   Context to include in the prompt: CSV parser bug — fails on empty rows, write a reproducing test
   Output: tests/test_csv_parser.py::test_empty_rows (failing test)

2. Task is Fix with subagent_type="python3-development:python-cli-architect"
   Context to include in the prompt: tests/test_csv_parser.py path, fix CSV parser to handle empty rows
   Output: packages/csv_parser.py updated — test_empty_rows now passes

3. Validation:
   uv run pytest — verify bug test passes and no regression

4. Task is Review with subagent_type="python3-development:python-code-reviewer"
   Context to include in the prompt: packages/csv_parser.py and tests/test_csv_parser.py paths
   Output: Verification fix addresses root cause, not symptom

5. Apply standards:
   /python3-development:modernpython packages/csv_parser.py
   Activate holistic-linting skill on packages/csv_parser.py tests/
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't: Write Python code as orchestrator

```text
❌ Orchestrator writes implementation directly
```

### Do: Delegate to appropriate agent

```text
✅ Task is Implement with subagent_type="python3-development:python-cli-architect" — writes implementation
✅ Task is Review with subagent_type="python3-development:python-code-reviewer" — validates it
```

### Don't: Skip validation steps

```text
❌ Implement → Done (no tests, no review, no linting)
```

### Do: Follow complete workflow

```text
✅ Implement → Test → Review → Validate → Done
```

### Don't: Mix agent contexts

```text
❌ Ask python3-development:stdlib-scripting to build Typer CLI
❌ Ask python-cli-architect to avoid all dependencies
```

### Do: Choose correct agent for context

```text
✅ python-cli-architect for user-facing CLI tools
✅ python3-development:stdlib-scripting for stdlib-only scripts
```

## Summary

**Orchestration = Coordination, Not Implementation**

1. Choose the right agent for the task
2. Provide clear inputs (file paths, not file contents)
3. Chain agents for complex workflows (architect → test → implement → review)
4. Always validate with quality gates
5. Use commands for standards checking
6. Integrate with uv skill for package management

**Success = Right agent + File paths as context + Validation gates passed**
