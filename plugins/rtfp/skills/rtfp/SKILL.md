# RTFP — Read The Fucking Prompt

Scan a Claude Code session transcript for the single strongest user reaction to an assistant instruction-following failure. Render it as a terminal-style PNG for sharing.

Output is exactly three things: what they were doing, what Claude said, how the user reacted.

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- One clean moment — not a report
- Do NOT build a taxonomy of failure types
- Do NOT add scoring or severity ratings
- Do NOT add verdicts or evaluative summaries
- Do NOT analyze why the misunderstanding occurred
- Do NOT produce session-wide analytics

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — List Sessions

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/rtfp/scripts/list_sessions.py --json
```

Present the numbered list to the user. Ask which session to inspect. Wait for the user's selection (by number or session ID) before proceeding.

### Step 2 — Extract Batches

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/rtfp/scripts/extract_batches.py <session_jsonl_path> --out-dir /tmp/rtfp-batches-<sessionid>
```

The script outputs a JSON array of batch file paths. Capture that list — each path is one batch to scan in Step 3.

### Step 3 — Fan-Out Scan (one subagent per batch)

Spawn one general-purpose subagent per batch file. Each subagent receives its assigned batch file path and these instructions:

```text
Read the batch JSON file at <batch_file_path>.
Scan all user messages for strong emotional reactions targeted at the assistant:
frustration, disbelief, insults, argument, rage, or clearly negative emotional
responses aimed at the AI's behavior.

Produce TWO outputs:

1. Write a JSON file to /tmp/rtfp-flagged-<batch_index>.json with this format:
   {"source_file": "<batch_file_path>", "flagged_indexes": [N, ...]}
   Write an empty flagged_indexes array if no reactions are found.

2. Print a plain list of flagged entries to your output:
   each line: <message_index> | <first 200 chars of content>
```

Wait for all subagents to finish before proceeding.

### Step 4 — Merge Flagged Indexes

Read each `/tmp/rtfp-flagged-<batch_index>.json` file produced in Step 3. Merge all `flagged_indexes` arrays into a single working set keyed by source file. If no indexes were flagged across all batches, report that to the user and stop.

### Step 5 — Pick the Winner (final subagent)

Spawn one general-purpose subagent with the merged working set and the original session JSONL path. Instructions to that subagent:

```text
You have a merged set of flagged message indexes from a Claude Code session transcript.
Session JSONL file: <session_jsonl_path>
Flagged indexes: <merged_working_set_as_json>

1. Read the full session JSONL file.
2. Read every flagged user message at the given indexes.
3. Choose the single most emotional, rage-filled response as the winner.
   Optionally identify one runner-up.
4. Determine what the user was currently doing when the reaction occurred —
   write one dry background line describing the activity, not the incident.
   CORRECT:   "writing a Claude Code plugin"
   CORRECT:   "refactoring test fixtures"
   INCORRECT: "the assistant ignored the constraint about scoring"
   INCORRECT: "failure to follow the instruction to omit scoring"
5. Identify the assistant message(s) immediately preceding the winning reaction.
6. Write /tmp/rtfp-result.json with exactly these fields:
   {
     "task_summary": "<dry one-line activity description>",
     "triggering_assistant_output": "<triggering assistant output>",
     "user_reaction": "<winning emotional user reply>"
   }
```

Wait for the subagent to finish. Verify `/tmp/rtfp-result.json` exists before proceeding.

### Step 6 — Render PNG

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/rtfp/scripts/render_artifact.py --input-file /tmp/rtfp-result.json --output rtfp_artifact.png
```

The script produces a terminal-style dark PNG with:

- Title bar: "rtfp — Read The Fucking Prompt" with red/yellow/green dots
- `task:` + dry activity line
- Divider
- `claude:` + triggering assistant output (truncated to fit if needed)
- Divider
- `user:` + emotional user reply in vivid/bright color

### Step 7 — Report

Report the output PNG path to the user. Display the three fields as text in the response:

```text
task:      <dry activity line>
claude:    <assistant excerpt>
user:      <emotional reply>

PNG: rtfp_artifact.png
```
