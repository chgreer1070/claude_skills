# FastMCP Creator

Expert-level guidance for building FastMCP v3 Python MCP servers — tools, resources, prompts,
providers, transforms, auth, testing, and production deployment. Grounded in local v3.1 docs;
no speculation.

## The Problem It Solves

FastMCP v3 introduced a provider/transform architecture that is fundamentally different from
v2. Code written from training-data memory uses deprecated syntax — `@mcp.tool()` with
parentheses, missing `task=True` for background tools, wrong transport flags. This plugin
loads verified v3.1 reference docs and enforces correct patterns at every step.

## What's Inside

| Component | Name | Activates on |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| Skill | `fastmcp-creator` | Building, extending, or debugging FastMCP v3 servers |
| Skill | `fastmcp-client-cli` | Running `fastmcp list` / `fastmcp call` against a running server |
| Skill | `fastmcp-python-tests` | Writing pytest suites for FastMCP servers |

## Quick Start

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Jamie-BitFlight/claude_skills
/plugin install fastmcp-creator@jamie-bitflight-skills
```

Then ask Claude to build a server:

```
Build an MCP server that wraps the GitHub REST API — issues and PRs only.
```

Claude will load the v3.1 reference docs, select the right provider type and transport, write
validated Python, and include tests.

## Minimal Server

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("my-server")

@mcp.tool  # no parentheses — v3 canonical syntax
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Return a greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## What Claude Can Build With This Plugin

**Compose multiple servers**

```python
mcp.mount(sub_server, namespace="github")
```

**Wrap a remote HTTP server as stdio**

```python
from fastmcp import create_proxy
mcp = create_proxy("http://remote-service/mcp")
```

**Serve files or Claude skills as resources**

```python
from fastmcp.providers import FileSystemProvider
mcp = FastMCP("docs", providers=[FileSystemProvider("./docs/")])
```

**Search large tool catalogs**

```python
from fastmcp.transforms import BM25SearchTransform
```

**Run long tasks without blocking**

```python
@mcp.tool(task=True)
async def long_job(params: str) -> str: ...
```

**Add auth (OAuth, JWT, PropelAuth)**

```python
from fastmcp.auth import MultiAuth, require_scopes
```

**Return interactive UI from tools**

```python
@mcp.tool(app=True)
def dashboard() -> PrefabApp: ...
```

## Skill Trigger Matrix

The `fastmcp-creator` skill activates automatically when you:

- Create or modify a FastMCP server file
- Ask about tool/resource/prompt creation
- Need provider composition (`mount()`, `ProxyProvider`, `FileSystemProvider`)
- Configure transforms (`ToolTransform`, `BM25SearchTransform`, `CodeMode`)
- Set up authentication (`MultiAuth`, `PropelAuth`, `require_scopes`)
- Write a FastMCP client (`Client`, transports, `BearerAuth`)
- Deploy to production (HTTP, stdio, nginx reverse proxy, Prefect Horizon)
- Migrate from FastMCP v2

## Testing MCP Servers

The `fastmcp-python-tests` skill covers in-memory transport testing (no real network required),
pytest fixtures, inline snapshots for complex output, async patterns, and the `CliRunner`
test harness.

```python
from fastmcp import Client
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def client(mcp_server):  # in-memory transport
    return Client(mcp_server)

async def test_greet(client):
    result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "world"})
    assert result.content[0].text == "Hello, world!"
```

## Querying a Running Server

The `fastmcp-client-cli` skill covers `fastmcp list` and `fastmcp call`:

```bash
# Discover what tools a server exposes
fastmcp list --command "uv run --script server.py"

# Call a tool
fastmcp call --command "uv run --script server.py" greet '{"name": "world"}'
```

## Version Coverage

| Version | Status |
|---------|--------|
| FastMCP 3.1 | Current — full coverage |
| FastMCP 3.0 | Available — all core features |
| FastMCP v2 | Legacy reference; migration guide included |
| TypeScript | Legacy reference only — not updated for v3 |

## Requirements

- Claude Code v2.0+
- Python 3.11+
- `uv` (the plugin's MCP reference server runs via `uv run`)
