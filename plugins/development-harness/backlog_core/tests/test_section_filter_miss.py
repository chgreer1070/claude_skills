"""RED tests for ViewItemResult.section_filter_miss feature.

These tests MUST FAIL before implementation and PASS after.

Feature: Add ``section_filter_miss: bool = False`` to ``ViewItemResult``.
When ``_apply_body_section_filter`` finds no matching section header for the
requested ``section=`` parameter it sets ``result.section_filter_miss = True``
and leaves ``result.body`` unchanged.  The flag is exposed in all three
``backlog_view`` response shapes (full, compact/summary, and over-budget).

Test coverage:
    1. ``_apply_body_section_filter`` sets flag when section NOT found.
    2. ``_apply_body_section_filter`` does NOT set flag when section IS found.
    3. ``view_item`` full response includes ``section_filter_miss: True``
       when section header is absent.
    4. ``view_item`` compact response (include_content=False) includes
       ``section_filter_miss: True`` when section header is absent.
    5. ``_build_compact_manifest`` (summary shape) includes
       ``section_filter_miss: True`` from a result that already has the flag set.
    6. ``_build_over_budget_view`` (over-budget shape) includes
       ``section_filter_miss: True`` from a result that already has the flag set.

All six test functions contain ``section_filter_miss`` in their names so
``pytest -k section_filter_miss`` selects the entire suite.
