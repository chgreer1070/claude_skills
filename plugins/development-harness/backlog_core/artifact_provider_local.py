"""Local filesystem implementation of the ArtifactBackend protocol.

Stores artifact manifests at ``~/.dh/projects/{slug}/artifacts/{issue_number}.json``
(one file per issue, matching architect ADR-001) and artifact content files at
``{root_worktree}/{artifact_id}`` (same convention as remote providers).

Advisory locking via ``fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)`` on a per-issue ``.lock`` file
prevents manifest corruption under concurrent writes.  Reads are lock-free
because ``os.replace`` is atomic — a reader sees either the old or the new
manifest, never a partial write.

All writes are atomic: content is written to a temporary file, then
``os.replace`` replaces the target atomically.  The temporary file is deleted
on failure via a ``try/finally`` guard.

Lock files are never deleted (TOCTOU risk per architect ADR-003).

Uses only the standard library (``json``, ``os``, ``fcntl``, ``tempfile``,
``pathlib``, ``datetime``, ``typing``), plus Pydantic models already available
in this package.
