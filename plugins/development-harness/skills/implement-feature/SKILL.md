description: Execute a SAM task plan (plan/tasks-*.md) by looping ready tasks, delegating each to its specified agent, and relying on hooks to update task timestamps/status. Use when a task file exists and you need to run the implementation loop that picks up ready tasks and delegates them to agents.

# Implement Feature (SAM Workflow Execution)

As you review code, update your agent memory with patterns, conventions, and recurring issues you discover.

This workflow continues from `add-new-feature`. It executes tasks from a SAM task file until complete (or blocked).

<feature_input>$ARGUMENTS</feature_input>

---

## Resolve Task File

Rules:

- If `<feature_input/>` ends with `.md`, treat it as the task file path and extract the plan address `P{N}` from the filename (e.g., `plan/tasks-3-integrate-sam-schema.md` → `P3`).
- Otherwise, treat it as a feature slug (or partial slug) and resolve plan address via `sam status`:

```bash
uv run sam status "<feature_input/>"
```

---

## Progress Loop

1. Query status:

```bash
uv run sam status P{N}
```

2. If tasks remain, query ready tasks:

If parent story issue number is known, prefer the MCP tool:

```text
backlog_get_ready_sam_tasks(parent_issue_number=N)
Output shape: {"feature": "...", "ready_tasks": [...], "count": N}
Falls back to local cache if GitHub unavailable.
```

If parent issue number is unknown (or MCP unavailable), use CLI fallback:

```bash
uv run sam ready P{N} --format json
```

3. For each ready task:

- Route to the agent named in the task's `agent` field (or resolved from `role`).
- Check the task's `skills` list from the ready-tasks JSON output.
- If `skills` is non-empty, include skill-loading instructions in the delegation prompt:

```text
Before starting work, load these skills: {comma-separated skill names}.
For each skill, call: Skill(skill="{skill-name}")
```

- If `skills` is empty or missing, do not add skill-loading instructions (backward compatible).
- Launch the agent with a prompt that invokes `start-task`:

```text
Skill(skill="start-task", args="{task_file_path} --task {task_id}")
```

> **Note**: Task-level skills are additive to agent-level skills. If the agent definition
> already declares skills via its frontmatter, task-level skills supplement them (they do not
> replace agent-level skills). Loading the same skill twice is a no-op.

4. Repeat until no tasks remain ready.

> **Hook behavior on SubagentStop**: When a sub-agent finishes, `task_status_hook.py` marks
> the task complete in the local task file. After marking the task complete locally, the hook
> calls `backlog_core.github.update_task_status()` to sync the completion to the GitHub
> sub-issue (if `github_issue` field is set in the task YAML). GitHub sync failure does not
> affect the hook exit code.

## Bookend Task Ordering

When the plan contains `acceptance-criteria-structured` entries, `swarm-task-planner` generates T0 and TN bookend tasks. No special handling is needed in this loop — existing readiness logic dispatches them in the correct order automatically:

- **T0** has `priority: 1` and `dependencies: []`, so it is the first ready task and dispatches before any implementation task.
- **TN** has `dependencies: [all non-bookend task IDs]`, so it becomes ready only after all implementation tasks complete and dispatches last.

T0 runs agent `t0-baseline-capture`. TN runs agent `tn-verification-gate`. Both agents write YAML result files (`plan/T0-baseline-{slug}.yaml`, `plan/TN-verification-{slug}.yaml`) that `/complete-implementation` reads in its pre-Phase 1 check.

## Completion Gate

When all tasks show `COMPLETE`, invoke:

```text
Skill(skill="complete-implementation", args="{task_file_path}")
```
