The following diagram is the authoritative procedure for Final Handoff Output. Execute steps in the exact order shown, including branches, decision points, and stop conditions.

## Concerns Check — Implementation Notes

The first step reads the Concerns section of the just-resolved issue before routing to the next work item.

**Selector source (`#{N}`)**: The resolved issue number is available from the **"Apply status:verified Label" Step 2** of the `complete-implementation` skill — that step calls `backlog_list(title="{slug}")`, finds the matched item, and extracts `issue_number` from the item's `issue` field (e.g., `"#2437"` → `issue_number = 2437`). Use that integer as `#{N}` in the `backlog_view` call below.

**Call signature**:

```text
backlog_view(selector="#{N}", summary=False, section="Concerns")
```

**Active-entry detection**: An entry is active if it is NOT struck-through (`` ~~entry~~ ``) and NOT a checked checkbox (`[x] entry`). Inactive entries were processed during the P6 Concerns verification phase — only active entries are actionable at handoff.

**Display format when active entries exist**:

```text
## Unresolved Concerns from #{N}

- {entry text verbatim}
...

Review these concerns before proceeding. You may choose to create backlog items for any that require follow-on work.
```

The Concerns block is displayed first, followed by a blank line separator, before any slug-search output.

**Error handling**: If `backlog_view` returns an `error` key, output `⚠ Could not read Concerns section: {error}` and continue to the slug search. The Concerns check is advisory — backend errors must not block Final Handoff.

**`section=` caveat**: The `section=` parameter has no effect on GitHub-only items with a raw body — the full body may be returned. When this occurs, scan the response body for a `## Concerns` heading and extract the list items beneath it. Apply active-entry detection to those items only.
