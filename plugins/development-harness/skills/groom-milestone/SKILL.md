description: "Grooms a GitHub milestone for parallel execution — batch-grooms ungroomed items, assesses scope gaps, analyzes cross-item dependencies via Impact Radius overlap, builds conflict groups, assigns items to execution waves, and persists the dispatch plan via dispatch_create_plan MCP tool. Calls dispatch_wave_start per wave to register state. Use when preparing a milestone for /work-milestone execution. Pass the milestone number as the first argument. Requires milestone items assigned via /group-items-to-milestone."

# Groom Milestone

Prepare a GitHub milestone for parallel execution by `/work-milestone`.

## Outcome

All items in the milestone are groomed, dependency-analyzed, and conflict-grouped — producing a dispatch plan that `/work-milestone` can execute without further human input except blocker resolution.

## Entry Conditions

- Milestone number provided as first argument
- Milestone exists on GitHub with state=open
- At least one item assigned to the milestone (via `/group-items-to-milestone`)
- Backlog MCP server responding

## Exit Conditions

- Every item in the milestone has `groomed: true`
- A priority-ordered list with wave assignments is produced
- A dependency graph (item-to-item) is produced with conflict groups identified
- Any items recommended for splitting have been split (user-approved)
- Any items recommended for addition have been added (user-approved)
- Dispatch plan file written at `plan/milestone-{N}-dispatch.yaml`

## MCP Tools Used

- `backlog_list_issues(milestone=N)` — load milestone items and groomed status
- `backlog_view(selector)` — read individual item Impact Radius and metadata
- `backlog_groom(selector)` — trigger grooming for ungroomed items
- `backlog_update(selector, ...)` — assign milestone, update item fields

## MCP Tools — Dispatch (Backlog Server)

The backlog MCP server exposes these dispatch tools used at plan-write time:

- `dispatch_create_plan(milestone_number, plan, overwrite, validate, issue)` — Step 9: validates and persists the dispatch plan atomically; `plan` is a typed DispatchPlan object; use overwrite=True when re-grooming a stale plan
- `dispatch_wave_start(milestone, wave_num, items)` — Step 9: registers each wave in the dispatch state database; call after dispatch_create_plan to initialise wave state
- `dispatch_wave_status(milestone, wave_num)` — available after `/work-milestone` launches; returns item-level progress with stale PID detection

The dispatch plan is persisted via the `dispatch_create_plan` MCP tool, which validates the DispatchPlan object against the schema and writes atomically. The DispatchPlan schema is defined in [./references/dispatch-plan-schema.md](./references/dispatch-plan-schema.md). The conflict analysis and wave assignment logic (Steps 5–9) runs in-session — it does not call external module functions.

## Error Handling

- Milestone not found or closed: report and stop — do not create a dispatch plan for a closed milestone
- Backlog MCP unavailable: emit PROCESS ERROR format with exact error text; do not proceed
- No items in milestone: report, suggest running `/group-items-to-milestone` first
- Grooming agent fails for an item: log the error, continue grooming remaining items, report all failures at the end
- Impact Radius missing after grooming: re-trigger groom for that item once; if still missing, flag as BLOCKED in the report
- Wave ordering or dependency reference errors found during plan build: fix before writing the plan file and calling `dispatch_wave_start`

## Backend Requirements

**GitHub backend only.** The GitHub milestone is the organizing primitive for this skill.
All milestone lookup (`backlog_list_issues(milestone=N)`), wave registration, and dispatch plan
storage assume GitHub Issues as the source of truth.

**Beads backend**: GitHub milestones are not available in beads repos. Do not run this skill
against a beads-backed project. The beads equivalent of wave membership is the `dh:wave:<N>`
label, managed by the Beads Dispatch Adapter during `/work-milestone` execution. Use the
dispatch adapter tooling directly rather than this skill.

**Other non-GitHub backends**: Behavior is undefined. Report `PROCESS ERROR — groom-milestone
requires GitHub backend` and stop if backlog MCP reports a non-GitHub backend.
