# RT-ICA Gate (Step 3.2)

## RT-ICA Staleness Policy

An RT-ICA result is stale and must be re-run if either condition is true: (a) the `Date:` header in the RT-ICA section is older than 7 calendar days, or (b) the item's `metadata.updated_at` field is newer than the RT-ICA section date. A stale RT-ICA result is treated as absent — `dh:rt-ica` is re-run before proceeding to [feasibility-gate.md](./feasibility-gate.md). The 7-day threshold applies regardless of whether the item description has changed, because codebase context may have changed even if the item text has not.

```

When the flowchart routes to "Run dh:rt-ica":

```text
Skill(skill: "dh:rt-ica")
```

Log re-run reason: `RT-ICA re-run: {staleness reason — date older than 7 days / updated_at
newer than RT-ICA date}` to the item's RT-ICA section as a prefix before the new result.

- **Present and fresh** — use the APPROVED/BLOCKED decision from the cached result. Carry DERIVABLE items forward as "Assumptions to confirm" in the feature request.
- **BLOCKED** — stop. Do not proceed to [feasibility-gate.md](./feasibility-gate.md) until all MISSING conditions are resolved.
