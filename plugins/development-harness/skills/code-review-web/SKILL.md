# Web Frontend Code Review Patterns

Stack-specific rules loaded by `dh:code-reviewer` when `*.html`, `*.css`, or `*.jsx` (browser-targeted) files are detected.

## Accessibility

- Every interactive element (button, link, input, select) must have an accessible name — either visible text, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`
- Focus must be managed when modals, dialogs, or dynamic panels open — trap focus inside and restore it on close
- Color contrast ratio must meet WCAG AA — 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold)
- Icon-only buttons without visible text must have `aria-label` or a visually-hidden text span
- Form inputs must be associated with their label via `for`/`id` pairing or `aria-labelledby` — proximity alone is not sufficient
- Images conveying information must have descriptive `alt` text; decorative images use `alt=""`
- Keyboard navigation must work — focus order must follow visual order, no focus traps outside intentional modal patterns

## XSS Prevention

- `element.innerHTML = userValue` is a blocking finding — use `textContent` for plain text
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React) or equivalent without sanitization is a blocking finding
- User-controlled values used in `eval()`, `Function()`, or `setTimeout(string)` are a blocking finding
- URL values from user input used in `href`, `src`, or `action` attributes must be validated against an allowlist of schemes (block `javascript:`, `data:`)

## Performance

- Layout thrash — reading layout properties (`offsetWidth`, `getBoundingClientRect`) inside a loop that also writes styles — is a blocking finding
- Images must have explicit `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shift (CLS)
- Images below the fold must use `loading="lazy"` — eager loading of off-screen images delays critical rendering
- Large JavaScript bundles loaded synchronously in `<head>` without `defer` or `async` are a blocking finding
- Expensive computations inside render functions (React `render`, Vue template expressions) without memoization are a blocking finding

## CSS

- `!important` without an explanatory comment is a blocking finding
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) must use CSS custom properties (`--color-primary`) — hardcoded hex values and px values are non-blocking but flagged
- Magic `z-index` values without a documented z-index scale are a blocking finding — use named tokens (`z-index: var(--z-modal)`)
- `position: fixed` or `position: sticky` without overflow and scroll container awareness is flagged
- `*` selectors in component styles that may bleed into child components are a blocking finding

## Forms

- Every `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` must have an associated `<label>` (either wrapping or via `for`/`id`)
- `autocomplete` attributes must be set on inputs that collect personal data (name, email, address, payment) — required for WCAG 1.3.5
- Validation error messages must be associated with the field via `aria-describedby` — color alone is not sufficient to communicate errors
- Form submission must not clear field values without user confirmation when validation fails

## Event Listener Cleanup

- Event listeners added in component mount / setup must be removed in the corresponding unmount / cleanup
- `document.addEventListener` without a corresponding `removeEventListener` in the cleanup lifecycle is a blocking finding
- `AbortController` is preferred for fetch-and-cleanup patterns — pass the signal and abort on cleanup

## Anti-Patterns

```html
<!-- WRONG: no label, no accessible name -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Search..." />

<!-- RIGHT: associated label -->
<label for="search">Search</label>
<input type="text" id="search" autocomplete="off" />

<!-- WRONG: XSS vector -->
<div id="output"></div>
<script>
  document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = userInput;
</script>

<!-- RIGHT: safe text insertion -->
<script>
  document.getElementById("output").textContent = userInput;
</script>
```

```css
/* WRONG: magic z-index */
.modal { z-index: 9999; }

/* RIGHT: design token */
.modal { z-index: var(--z-modal); }

/* WRONG: unexplained !important */
.button { color: red !important; }

/* RIGHT: explained override */
/* Overrides third-party widget styles that cannot be targeted more specifically */
.widget-container .button { color: red !important; }
```
