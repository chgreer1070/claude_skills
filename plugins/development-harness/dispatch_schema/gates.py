    Each command string is tokenised with shlex.split, resolved via shutil.which,
    and executed via subprocess.run with captured output. No shell=True is used.

    When a command executable is not found on PATH, a CommandResult with
    exit_code=127 and passed=False is recorded — no exception is raised — and
    mode logic applies as normal.

    When a command exceeds the timeout, subprocess.TimeoutExpired is caught (not
    propagated) and converted to a CommandResult with exit_code=124 and
    passed=False, following the Unix timeout(1) convention. Mode logic applies as
    normal.

    OSError raised by subprocess.run after a successful which() lookup propagates
    to the caller; that indicates a runtime environment failure, not a gate check
    failure.

    Args:
        commands: List of shell-style command strings to execute in order.
        mode: GateRunMode.FAIL_FAST stops after the first failing command.
            GateRunMode.RUN_ALL collects all results regardless of failure.
        cwd: Working directory for subprocess execution. None inherits the
            current process working directory.
        timeout: Per-command timeout in seconds. Default 300.0. When a command
            exceeds this limit, subprocess.run raises TimeoutExpired, which is
            caught and recorded as exit_code=124.

    Returns:
        GateResult with passed=True iff every CommandResult.passed is True,
        plus the list of CommandResult values collected under the given mode.
