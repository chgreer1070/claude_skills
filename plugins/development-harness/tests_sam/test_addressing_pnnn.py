"""Tests for P{NNN} addressing scheme -- plan number resolution and backward compatibility.

Tests: Numeric plan resolution, slug resolution, collision detection, backward
compatibility fallback, and property-based plan number validation.
How: Create filesystem fixtures with P{NNN}-{slug} and tasks-{N}-{slug} files,
invoke resolve_plan_address, and verify resolution results.
Why: Addressing is the lookup layer -- incorrect resolution silently accesses
the wrong plan file, causing agents to read/write the wrong tasks.

Note: This test module focuses on the NEW P{NNN} addressing scheme added in T03.
The existing test_addressing.py covers the base addressing functionality.
