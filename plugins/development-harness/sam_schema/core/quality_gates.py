"""Quality gate plan generator for the complete-implementation workflow.

Produces YAML strings for quality-gate plans passed to ``sam_create`` by
the ``complete-implementation`` skill:

- ``build_quality_gate_plan``: 6-task plan (QG prefix) for SAM-planned features.
- ``build_proportional_quality_gate_plan``: 3-task plan (PQG prefix) for
  issue-only fixes that bypass the SAM planning pipeline.

Both functions are pure — no file I/O, no MCP calls, no side effects.
