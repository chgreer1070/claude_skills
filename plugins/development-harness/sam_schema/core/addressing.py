"""Plan addressing module for SAM task/plan files.

Resolves human-readable address strings (``P1/T3``, ``P1``, ``QG3``,
``QG3/T1``, ``my-slug/T3``) to file system paths, and parses address
components for use by the CLI and MCP server.

Address format:
    ``P{N}``         — plan by sequence number (matches ``P{NNN}-{slug}.*`` filename)
    ``QG{N}``        — quality-gate plan (matches ``QG{NNN}-{slug}.*`` filename)
    ``{slug}``       — plan by slug substring match (matches ``P*-{slug}.*``)
    ``P{N}/T{M}``    — task within a plan
    ``QG{N}/T{M}``   — task within a quality-gate plan
    ``{slug}/T{M}``  — task within a plan by slug

Backward compatibility:
    If no ``P{NNN}-*`` pattern matches, falls back to ``tasks-{N}-{slug}``
    naming for unmigrated files. This fallback is explicitly temporary and
    will be removed after all plan files are renamed.
