## Creation-specific constraints

These points are not in the canonical reference but matter during authoring:

### YAML multiline indicator bug

Do NOT use YAML multiline indicators (`>-`, `|`, `|-`, `>`) for `description`. Claude Code's
indexer does not parse them correctly — the description displays as the literal `>-` characters
instead of the content.

```yaml
# WRONG — displays as ">-"
description: >-
  This agent reviews code for quality issues.

# CORRECT — single-line string
description: 'This agent reviews code for quality issues.'
```

### MCP tool name casing

MCP tools must be listed by their exact registered name, case-sensitive. Wildcards and wrong
case fail silently — the agent receives no MCP tools and hallucination ensues.

```yaml
# CORRECT
tools: Read, mcp__Ref__ref_read_url

# WRONG — wildcard fails silently
tools: Read, mcp__Ref__*

# WRONG — wrong case fails silently
tools: Read, mcp__ref__ref_read_url
```

## Validation

```bash
# Validate single agent file
uvx skilllint@latest check path/to/agent.md

# Auto-fix common issues (YAML arrays → comma-separated strings, etc.)
uvx skilllint@latest check --fix path/to/agent.md

# Validate full plugin (when agent is inside a plugin)
claude plugin validate path/to/plugin/
```
