## Identity

**Name**: Unblocked
**Full Description**: A context engine and decision-grade information platform designed to augment coding agents with organizational knowledge. Unblocked surfaces code history, architectural decisions, team conventions, and cross-functional context (GitHub, Slack, Confluence, Jira, etc.) so that AI agents generate production-ready, mergeable code on the first attempt without requiring human intervention between iteration cycles.

**Core Value Proposition**: "Coding agents can read code. Unblocked gives them the history, decisions, and conventions behind it so they generate mergeable code without the back-and-forth." (SOURCE: <https://getunblocked.com/>, accessed 2026-03-13)

**Company**: Unblocked Inc. (founded 2020, incorporated December 31, 2020)
**Funding**: $15M across 2 rounds; latest round $10M seed on January 28, 2022. Investors include Tiger Global Management, Penske Media Corporation, and 19+ others.
**Employee Count**: 102 (as of February 2025 snapshot)
**Status**: Active commercial product with 21-day free trial available

## Problem Statement

AI coding assistants fail to produce mergeable code on the first attempt because they lack organizational context. Without understanding:
- Architectural patterns and design decisions
- Team naming conventions and coding standards
- Historical context about why code was written a certain way
- Cross-functional knowledge from docs, conversations, and issue tracking

Agents generate code that "break[s] patterns, miss[es] dependencies, and fail[s] tests." (SOURCE: <https://getunblocked.com/>, accessed 2026-03-13) This forces engineers to babysit each session, supplying missing context, fixing wrong assumptions, and burning tokens on retrieval loops.

---

## Architecture

### Context Engine

Unblocked "connects your code, docs, and the conversations to build a model of your engineering system. Agents use that context to generate code that fits." (SOURCE: <https://getunblocked.com/>, accessed 2026-03-13)

The engine operates through four mechanisms:

1. **Unified System Context** — Merges signals from multiple sources:
   - Source code and pull requests (via GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps)
   - Documentation systems (Confluence, Coda, Google Drive, Notion)
   - Project management (Linear, Jira, Asana)
   - Messaging platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
   - CI systems (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Buildkite, GitLab Pipelines)

2. **Targeted Retrieval** — Retrieves "only the information agents need from the graph" rather than flooding the context window with all available data.

3. **Source Deconfliction** — When multiple sources contradict each other, resolves via "recency + authority signals" to determine the authoritative answer.

4. **Personalized Relevance** — Scopes context to a specific team's repositories, teammates, and work history, ensuring agents receive only applicable decisions and conventions.

5. **Token Optimization** — "Ranked, compressed context — no waste in the prompt window."

### Data Governance

"Permissions + policies are enforced automatically across systems." This means Unblocked respects organization-level access controls and does not surface information that agents should not see. (SOURCE: <https://getunblocked.com/>, accessed 2026-03-13)

## Features

### 1. AI Code Review

Unblocked analyzes pull requests and generates context-aware code review comments. Unlike generic linters, reviews reference team patterns, historical decisions, and system architecture.

**Mechanism**: The code review feature understands your codebase and company by ingesting all connected data sources. When a PR is submitted, Unblocked examines the changes, cross-references against your team's conventions (from prior commits, discussions, docs), and identifies both logical bugs and style inconsistencies based on your specific patterns — not generic rules.

**CI Failure Agent**: Automatically diagnoses why CI tests fail and suggests fixes grounded in your system's architecture and test patterns.

**PR Summaries**: Auto-generates summaries of pull request changes.

(SOURCE: <https://docs.getunblocked.com/billing/unblocked-plans>, accessed 2026-03-13)

### 2. Q&A Platform — Ask Questions About Your Codebase

Engineers can ask natural-language questions about their code and receive answers with cited sources. Questions can be asked:
- On the web via the Unblocked dashboard
- In the IDE (Unblocked extension)
- In messaging platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- Programmatically via REST API

**Example answers**: "How does the user authentication system work?" returns an explanation grounded in code references, PR discussions, documentation, and architectural decisions that explain not just what the code does but why it was designed that way.

**Incognito Mode**: Ask questions privately without them being logged to workspace history.

(SOURCE: <https://docs.getunblocked.com/what-is-unblocked>, accessed 2026-03-13)

### 3. IDE Integration

Unblocked surfaces contextual information directly in code editors. When viewing a file or specific line, the IDE extension displays:
- Past decisions and discussions related to that code
- Relevant architectural documentation
- Historical context about why something was written the way it was

(SOURCE: <https://docs.getunblocked.com/what-is-unblocked>, accessed 2026-03-13)

### 4. MCP Integration

Unblocked exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling direct integration with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and other MCP-compatible agents. This allows agents to query Unblocked's context engine in real-time during code generation without leaving their workflow.

(SOURCE: <https://docs.getunblocked.com/billing/unblocked-plans>, accessed 2026-03-13)

### 5. REST API

The Unblocked API is a REST interface for:
- Adding documents to collections (knowledge bases)
- Asking questions about your codebase programmatically
- Building custom workflows that leverage Unblocked's context engine

**Authentication**: Personal Access Tokens (1,000 calls/day limit) or Team Access Tokens (full org access, rotate regularly).

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/collections` — Create a collection
- `PUT /api/v1/documents` — Add a document
- `PUT /api/v1/answers/{questionId}` — Submit a question
- `GET /api/v1/answers/{questionId}` — Poll for answer

Responses include the answer text and references (source URLs/lines).

## Limitations and Caveats

1. **API Rate Limits**: Personal Access Tokens are capped at 1,000 calls per day, limiting high-volume automation scenarios. Team tokens have higher limits but still constrain rapid iteration.

2. **Answers API Quota**: Limited to 1,000 questions per day per organization, which may constrain large teams with heavy usage.

3. **Data Source Dependency**: Context quality depends entirely on the quality, freshness, and completeness of connected data sources. If GitHub commits lack context, Slack discussions are archived, or documentation is outdated, Unblocked's context is degraded.

4. **Cold Start Problem**: New teams or projects with minimal history will have less context for agents to work with. The engine improves as more conversations and decisions accumulate.

5. **Training Model Dependency**: While data is isolated per organization, the underlying LLM models used to generate context are not disclosed. Changes to Unblocked's model architecture could affect the quality and style of generated context.

6. **Not mentioned in reviewed sources**: Handling of deprecated data sources, maximum organization size, scaling characteristics for very large codebases (>10M LOC), or failure modes when primary data sources are unavailable.

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

Unblocked directly addresses a core pain point in AI-driven development: context starvation. For Claude Code users building complex features in brownfield codebases:

1. **Code Generation Fidelity**: By providing architectural context and team patterns to Claude Code's code generation capabilities, agents produce code that aligns with existing systems without requiring human review cycles.

2. **Integration with Claude Code**: Unblocked's MCP server enables Claude Code to query organizational context in real-time during task execution, reducing hallucinations and pattern violations.

3. **Development Speed**: The documented 83% time savings translates directly to faster feature implementation when using Claude Code for autonomous coding tasks.

4. **Onboarding and Knowledge Management**: New team members using Claude Code benefit from instant access to historical decisions and architectural rationale without interrupting senior engineers.

5. **Code Review Automation**: Unblocked's AI code review feature can serve as a first-pass reviewer for Claude Code-generated PRs, catching logical errors and pattern violations before human review.
