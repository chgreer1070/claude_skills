## Overview

Straion is a SaaS rules-management platform that dynamically injects organizational engineering
standards into AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) at task time. Instead of
static CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md files that dump every rule into every prompt regardless of
relevance, Straion's CLI selects and delivers only the rules applicable to the current task.
The platform also validates the AI agent's proposed task plan against those rules before any
code is written.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| AI coding agents ignore org-specific architecture rules, naming conventions, and security policies | Centralized rules hub with dynamic, per-task delivery to the agent via CLI |
| Static CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md files dump all rules every time, wasting tokens and reducing resolve rates | Relevance-aware rule selection — only rules pertinent to the current task are fetched |
| LLM-generated context files reduce agent resolve rates by ~3% and inflate cost >20% (ETH Zurich study) | Dynamic delivery replaces static files; Straion fetches the right context at the right moment |
| Code review becomes cleanup rather than quality leverage; senior engineers babysit AI output | Pre-implementation plan validation catches violations before tokens are spent on wrong code |
| Rules scattered across scattered `.md` files in different repos, encoded inconsistently | Single source of truth rule hub shared across all repositories and teams |
| Token burn and implementation detours from context mismatch multiply silently at scale | Task-scoped context injection eliminates irrelevant rules from every prompt |

## Key Features

### Dynamic Rule Injection

- Centralize architecture rules, security policies, and coding standards in Straion's rule hub
- CLI fetches only the rules relevant to the current task — not all rules every time
- Eliminates static AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md files that provide no relevance filtering
- Rules are delivered dynamically at the moment the agent needs them, before code is written

### Task Plan Validation

- Validates the AI agent's proposed implementation plan against organizational rules before coding starts
- Catches violations at the plan stage, not during code review
- Prevents wasted tokens on implementation detours that would be rejected anyway
- Positions rule enforcement at the planning gate rather than the review gate

### Multi-Tool Integration

- Native integration with Claude Code via a Straion skill (added to Claude Code setup)
- Native integration with Cursor (skill/extension model)
- Native integration with GitHub Copilot
- Single CLI installed globally; connects all AI tools to the same rule hub

### Centralized Standards Management

- Single rule hub across all repositories and teams
- Import existing engineering standards or create new ones in the platform
- Rules cover architecture decisions, security constraints, naming conventions, and internal coding patterns
- Eliminates rule fragmentation across scattered markdown files and stale docs

## Technical Architecture

Straion operates as a three-layer system:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Straion Rule Hub          │  (SaaS backend)
│  - Centralized rule storage         │
│  - Rule categorization and tagging  │
│  - Team/org management              │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────┘
                   │ REST/API (authenticated)
                   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Straion CLI               │  (locally installed)
│  - Receives task context            │
│  - Selects relevant rules           │
│  - Returns scoped rule set          │
│  - Invokes plan validation          │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────┘
                   │ Skill / MCP integration
                   ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        AI Coding Agent              │
│  (Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot)   │
│  - Receives only relevant rules     │
│  - Plan validated before coding     │
│  - Generates code within guardrails │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Workflow** (4 steps per task):

1. **Define Rules** — import or create engineering standards, security rules, coding guidelines in Straion
2. **Install the Skill** — add the Straion skill to the AI coding tool; it connects to the org rule hub
3. **AI Gets Context** — CLI dynamically fetches relevant rules for the current task before writing code
4. **Validate and Ship** — Straion validates the AI's task plan against rules; violations caught before tokens are spent

The key architectural differentiation versus static files is relevance-aware selection: the CLI
receives task context and returns a scoped rule subset, rather than dumping all rules into the
context window. This directly addresses the ETH Zurich finding that static context files reduce
agent resolve rates by ~3% and inflate cost by over 20%.

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- Straion directly targets Claude Code as a first-class integration — the product ships a Claude Code skill that connects to the Straion rule hub
- The problem Straion solves (org rules not reaching the AI agent) is exactly what this repository addresses with CLAUDE.md and skills
- Straion's dynamic delivery model is evidence that the static CLAUDE.md approach has measurable performance costs (ETH Zurich: -3% resolve rate, +20% token cost)

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Relevance-aware context injection**: Rather than loading all rules into every prompt, filter rules by task context — only inject what applies to the current file, task type, or domain
- **Pre-implementation plan validation**: Validate the agent's proposed approach against rules before execution begins; this is a gate pattern that prevents downstream correction loops
- **Rules as a service**: Treating engineering standards as first-class data (centralized, versioned, queryable) rather than markdown files is an architectural pattern applicable to skill/context design
- **Task-scoped context windows**: The ETH Zurich research cited by Straion provides empirical evidence that context relevance filtering outperforms complete context dumping

### Integration Opportunities

- Straion's Claude Code skill could be used alongside this repository's skill system to provide org-level rule enforcement as a complementary layer
- The dynamic context delivery pattern could inform how this repository structures context-management skills — fetching relevant rules per task rather than loading all of CLAUDE.md
- Straion's plan validation step maps closely to the `/verify` skill pattern in this repository; both gate on rule compliance before marking work complete
- Seed-stage company (€1.1M, February 2026) — early enough that API/integration patterns may still be shaping; worth monitoring for MCP server or API access
