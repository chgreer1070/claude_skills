# Improvement Proposals: Scrapling — Claude Code Web Scraping Skill

**Research entry**: ./research/developer-tools/scrapling-skill.md
**Generated**: 2026-03-13
**Patterns assessed**: 6
**Backlog items created**: 0
**Deferred (low confidence)**: 2
**Skipped (already covered or tracked)**: 4

## Improvement 1: Per-skill experience accumulation with structured pattern files

**Source pattern**: "Site patterns saved after successful scrapes (avoid re-solving same problem)" and "Experience Accumulation — After successful scrape, check whether new site pattern or cookie should be saved to vault" — Relevance section + Architecture section, Step 6
**Local system**: CLAUDE.md (memory), `.claude/rules/`
**Confidence**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Backlog**: Deferred — confidence medium: the local system already has MEMORY.md and `.claude/rules/` for persistent patterns. The scrapling skill's approach (structured domain-specific pattern files updated during skill execution) is more systematic, but the local system's general-purpose memory mechanism may already serve the same function through a different path. Would need to examine multiple skill sessions to determine whether the lack of per-skill structured pattern accumulation causes re-solving of previously-solved problems.

### Current state

Skills in this repository do not have a standardized mechanism for saving learned patterns back into their own reference files during execution. When a skill successfully handles a novel scenario, the knowledge is captured in MEMORY.md (session-level) or `.claude/rules/` (manually added), but not in a skill-local structured format that the skill can query on subsequent invocations.

### Target state

Skills that handle recurring problem types would include a `references/patterns.md` or similar structured file that gets updated after successful operations, keyed by problem characteristics. On subsequent invocations, the skill would check this file before applying its general decision tree.

### Measurable signal

A skill's `references/patterns.md` file would contain entries added during prior invocations, and the skill's SKILL.md would include a step to check patterns before proceeding with general logic.

## Improvement 2: Error-indexed troubleshooting guides as a skill structure standard

**Source pattern**: "Troubleshooting index keyed by error message (self-serve debugging)" — Relevance section, Maintenance Discipline subsection
**Local system**: `plugins/plugin-creator/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md`
**Confidence**: Medium
**Impact**: Low
**Backlog**: Deferred — confidence medium: local skills have ad-hoc troubleshooting content (e.g., ty skill, llamafile skill, dasel setup skill mention troubleshooting), but there is no standardized error-indexed format prescribed by the skill-creator. The scrapling skill's `troubleshooting.md` indexes solutions by exact error message string, which is more systematic. However, confirming that the absence of this standard causes actual failures would require examining skill usage sessions where users encountered errors that a troubleshooting index would have resolved.

### Current state

The skill-creator skill does not prescribe a standardized troubleshooting reference file format. Skills that include troubleshooting content do so in varying formats — some inline in SKILL.md, some in reference files with varying structures. No skill uses an error-message-keyed index format.

### Target state

The skill-creator's guidance would include an optional `references/troubleshooting.md` template with a standardized format: error message as heading, cause, and solution. Skills wrapping external tools or libraries would be encouraged to include this file.

### Measurable signal

The skill-creator SKILL.md or its reference files would include a troubleshooting template section. At least one existing skill would adopt the format.

## Deferred Proposals (confidence too low to backlog)

| Pattern | Confidence | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Per-skill experience accumulation with structured pattern files | Medium | Local system has MEMORY.md and rules/ for persistent patterns; would need session evidence showing re-solving of previously-solved problems to confirm the gap is material |
| Error-indexed troubleshooting guides as a skill structure standard | Medium | Local skills have ad-hoc troubleshooting content; would need to examine skill usage sessions to confirm the absence of a standardized format causes actual user friction |

## Skipped Patterns

| Pattern | Reason skipped |
|---|---|
| Skill activation triggers based on semantic intent matching | Already covered — skill frontmatter `description` field is the standard activation mechanism, documented in skill-creator SKILL.md and claude-skills-overview-2026 |
| Reference material organization (templates, patterns, vault) | Already covered — skill-creator prescribes `references/` directory with progressive disclosure; templates are a known pattern |
| Parameterized code generation workflow (decision tree to template to substitution) | Too abstract — this is a domain-specific workflow for web scraping, not a generalizable skill infrastructure pattern |
| Bilingual documentation (English + Chinese) | No failure mode — the local system has no internationalization requirement; this is a quality-of-life pattern with no observable gap |
