## Deferred Proposals (confidence too low to backlog)

| Pattern | Confidence | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Data Validation at Boundaries — zero-cost schema validation during JSON decode | Low | The research entry describes msgspec's validation-during-decode as a general library benefit, not as a response to a specific failure mode in this codebase. Local scripts (`task_status_hook.py`, `implementation_manager.py`) use `json.loads` with `dict[str, Any]` type hints and manual field extraction. A gap exists (no runtime schema validation on JSON inputs), but the research entry does not identify a concrete failure caused by this absence. To raise confidence: audit `json.loads` call sites for runtime errors caused by malformed input, then evaluate whether msgspec Struct decode would have prevented them. |

## Skipped Patterns

| Pattern | Reason skipped |
|---|---|
| Agent Communication — fast JSON validation for inter-agent messaging | Too abstract: local agents communicate via Claude Code Task tool and file artifacts, not JSON message passing. The pattern domain (inter-process JSON messaging) does not match the local architecture. |
| Configuration Serialization — Struct for config objects | Too abstract: research entry describes a library swap (dataclass to Struct) without identifying a failure mode. Local `dataclass` usage in `implementation_manager.py` functions correctly. Replacing it would be a library adoption decision, not a pattern-level improvement. |
| API Request/Response Handling — JSON encoding/decoding for HTTP | Not applicable: no local HTTP API servers or clients in the skill/agent infrastructure that would benefit from faster JSON encoding. |
| CLI Argument and Configuration Parsing — Struct-based config parsing | Not applicable: local CLI scripts use Typer for argument parsing, which serves a different purpose (CLI UX) than msgspec Structs (data serialization). No gap exists. |
