## Overview

Yume (Japanese: "dream") is a native desktop GUI wrapper around the Claude Code CLI that adds 30+ features the CLI does not provide, including zero-flicker rendering, parallel agent orchestration, auto-compaction, crash recovery, and multi-provider model support. It spawns the real Claude CLI process (not an API wrapper), so all CLI-native functionality -- subagents, MCP, hooks, skills, CLAUDE.md, @mentions, /commands -- works without modification. Built with Tauri + Rust (claimed 10x lighter than Electron), it also supports Gemini and OpenAI models via a yume-cli shim layer.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Yume Solution |
|---------|---------------|
| CLI terminal flickering (700+ developer upvotes on the issue) | Native rendering engine with zero flickering via Tauri + Rust |
| Input lag of 10+ seconds in long CLI sessions | Sub-50ms input response time regardless of session length |
| CLI crashes every 10-20 minutes in extended sessions (per Yume's claims) | 24-hour crash recovery with 5-minute state snapshots |
| No visibility into token usage or context window limits | Live mid-stream token count, token usage analytics by project/model/date, auto-compaction at 75% capacity |
| CLI is single-session only (no tabs or windows) | Tabs + windows with multiple simultaneous sessions |
| No visual tracking of file changes made by agents | Visual timeline of all file changes per message, with undo capability |
| CLI shows thinking output only after completion | Live interleaved thinking streamed in real-time |
| CLI uses a single generalist agent for all tasks | 4 specialist agents (Architect, Explorer, Implementer, Guardian) with role-based task decomposition |
| No built-in security guardrails beyond CLI permissions | Yume Guard: configurable security hook that blocks dangerous commands (e.g., rm -rf) |

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Tauri + Rust over Electron**: Claimed 10x lighter memory footprint than Electron-based alternatives. Native rendering avoids the terminal flickering inherent in web-based terminal emulators.

2. **CLI spawning (not API wrapping)**: Yume spawns the actual Claude Code CLI binary rather than making direct API calls. This ensures full compatibility with the CLI ecosystem (MCP, hooks, skills, CLAUDE.md, etc.) without reimplementation.

3. **yume-cli shim for multi-provider**: A shim layer intercepts CLI calls and routes them to Gemini or OpenAI when those models are selected, enabling multi-provider support without modifying the Claude CLI itself.

4. **Isolated git branches for parallel agents**: Each of the 4 parallel agents operates on its own git branch, preventing file conflicts during simultaneous execution.

5. **Auto-compaction at 75%**: Proactive context management triggers compaction before reaching the context window limit, preventing the session-ending "context full" state.

## Installation and Usage

### Download

Downloads available from the official website:

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: <https://aofp.github.io/yume/> (Apple Silicon build)
- **macOS (Intel)**: <https://aofp.github.io/yume/> (Intel build)
- **Windows**: <https://aofp.github.io/yume/> (Windows build)
- **Linux**: <https://aofp.github.io/yume/> (Linux build)

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI must be installed and authenticated (`claude` command available in PATH)
- For Gemini/OpenAI model support: yume-cli shim (bundled with Yume)

### Basic Usage

1. Download and install Yume for your platform
2. Launch Yume -- it automatically detects the Claude Code CLI
3. Open a project directory (project browser or file dialog)
4. Begin a session in a tab; all CLI features (MCP, hooks, skills, CLAUDE.md) work automatically
5. Use cmd+t for new tabs, cmd+o to switch models, cmd+k for ultrathink mode

### Key Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| cmd+t | New tab |
| cmd+o | Switch model |
| cmd+k | Ultrathink mode |
| cmd+l | Clear session |

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

1. **Agent Specialization Reference**: The 4-agent architecture (Architect/Explorer/Implementer/Guardian) demonstrates a structured approach to task decomposition where each agent has a constrained role. This mirrors the principle of specialized sub-agents found in the agent-orchestration skill, where task-appropriate agent selection improves output quality.

2. **Context Management Strategy**: Auto-compaction at 75% context capacity is a proactive approach to the context window limit problem. Rather than letting sessions fail at 100%, Yume compacts before reaching the limit. This pattern is relevant to any long-running Claude Code session management.

3. **Desktop GUI as CLI Enhancement Layer**: Yume demonstrates that a GUI wrapper can add substantial value (parallel agents, crash recovery, visual timelines) without replacing the underlying CLI. The "spawn real CLI" architecture preserves full ecosystem compatibility.

### Patterns Worth Adopting

1. **Specialist Agent Roles**: The Architect/Explorer/Implementer/Guardian decomposition maps to distinct phases of software development (plan, understand, implement, review). This pattern aligns with and extends the sub-agent selection guidance in this repository's CLAUDE.md, which distinguishes between explore agents (read-only search) and context-gathering agents (reasoning tasks).

2. **Proactive Context Compaction**: Triggering compaction at 75% rather than waiting for context exhaustion is a defensive pattern. Claude Code sessions that approach context limits often produce degraded output before hitting the hard limit. The 75% threshold provides a buffer.

3. **Context Auto-Loading by File Type**: Opening a .tsx file automatically loading React knowledge is a pattern for automatic skill activation. This aligns with the skill activation trigger concept where context is loaded based on detected conditions rather than explicit user invocation.

4. **Security Hook Layer (Yume Guard)**: A configurable security hook that blocks dangerous commands (rm -rf) before they execute is a pattern for agent safety. This parallels the hooks system in Claude Code but with a pre-built security-focused default configuration.

5. **Visual Change Timeline with Undo**: Tracking every file change per message and offering undo capability provides transparency into agent actions. This addresses the "what did the agent change?" visibility problem that exists in CLI-only workflows.

### Integration Opportunities

1. **Agent Role Definitions**: The Architect/Explorer/Implementer/Guardian role definitions could inform the design of specialized Claude Code agents or sub-agent selection criteria in the agent-orchestration skill.

2. **Compaction Threshold as a Configurable Setting**: The 75% auto-compaction threshold could be adopted as a recommended practice for long-running Claude Code sessions, potentially implemented as a hook that monitors context usage.

3. **File-Type Skill Activation**: The context auto-loading pattern (file type triggers skill loading) could be implemented as a Claude Code hook that detects opened/referenced file types and suggests or loads relevant skills.

### Considerations

1. **Unverified Claims**: Performance claims (sub-50ms response, CLI crashes every 10-20 minutes, 10x lighter than Electron) are sourced from Yume's marketing website. Independent benchmarks have not been located. These claims should be treated as unverified marketing assertions until independently confirmed.

2. **License Ambiguity**: The website states "free forever" but no specific open-source license is identified. The source code availability and terms of use are unclear. This affects any consideration of studying or adapting Yume's implementation patterns.

3. **CLI Dependency**: Yume requires the Claude Code CLI to be installed and functional. It is an enhancement layer, not a standalone product. Changes to the CLI's process model, output format, or authentication could break Yume's integration.

4. **Multi-Provider via Shim**: Gemini and OpenAI support is achieved through a yume-cli shim that intercepts CLI calls. This is an indirect integration that may not fully replicate the behavior or capabilities of native provider SDKs.

5. **Closed Source (Assumed)**: No public source repository has been identified for Yume itself (the GitHub profile github.com/aofp hosts the GitHub Pages site but the application source has not been located). This limits the ability to verify architectural claims or study implementation patterns directly.

6. **New Project**: No version number, release history, or community size metrics have been identified. The project's longevity and maintenance trajectory are unknown.
