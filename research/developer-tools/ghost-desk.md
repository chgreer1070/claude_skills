## Core Features

### 1. Always-On-Top Floating Interface

Ghost Desk maintains a persistent overlay that remains above every application on Windows. Two UI modes are available:

- **Taskbar Mode**: Minimal persistent indicator at screen edge
- **Chat Panel Mode**: Full-size conversation interface

The overlay floats above browsers, IDEs (Visual Studio Code examples shown), terminals, design tools, and note-taking applications. Users can toggle visibility using global keyboard shortcuts regardless of which application has focus.

### 2. Screen-Share Invisibility

The core distinguishing feature uses Windows SetWindowDisplayAffinity API at the OS level to exclude the overlay from all screen-capture pipelines. This means:

- **Zoom screen shares**: Ghost Desk overlay not visible to viewers
- **Microsoft Teams**: Overlay excluded from team member views
- **Google Meet**: Invisible during calls
- **OBS / Windows Game Bar / streaming software**: Not captured in recordings
- **Taskbar**: No icon appears; overlay not visible in Alt+Tab switcher
- **Task Manager**: Process not listed or findable by name
- **Screenshots**: Screenshots taken via Print Screen or Windows Snip tool exclude the overlay

**Verification**: Ghost Desk publishes daily verification status across 14+ platforms (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, Amazon Chime, Cisco Webex, Lark/Feishu, Slack, Discord, Skype, GoTo Meeting, RingCentral, BlueJeans, Whereby, Jitsi Meet) with last-updated timestamps (e.g., "Last updated 8hrs ago" as of website access on 2026-03-13).

The overlay remains click-through — when the user hovers or clicks on Ghost Desk, the system and active applications do not detect the input. No focus shifts occur.

### 3. AI Chat and Conversation

The chat interface accepts typed queries and maintains conversation context within a session. Answers stream token-by-token as they are generated. Follow-up questions and conversation refinement are supported.

**Example interaction shown on website**:
- User: "How do I debounce this event handler?"
- Ghost Desk: Returns a clean debounce utility function
- User: "Add a leading edge option?"
- Ghost Desk: Provides follow-up with leading-edge configuration

### 4. Voice Activation and Transcription

Ghost Desk accepts voice input with the following characteristics:

- Natural speech is transcribed directly by the system
- Smart silence detection filters background noise automatically
- No wake words or push-to-talk required — continuous listening available
- Voice output streams responses back to the user in speech form

### 5. Screenshot Analysis and Vision AI

Users can capture any rectangular region of the screen directly from within Ghost Desk. The overlay reads and analyzes:

- Source code snippets
- Document text
- Diagrams and visual content
- Tables and structured data

The vision AI provides instant explanations or analysis without switching to external tools.

**Example use cases shown**:
- Analyzing Python class definitions from VS Code editor
- Explaining LeetCode problem statements from browser
- Understanding complex asynchronous code patterns

### 6. Keyboard-Native Controls

All interaction is possible via global keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+Shift+Space | Toggle Ghost Desk visibility |
| Ctrl+Shift+C | Enable click-through mode |
| Ctrl+Shift+Q | Quick quit |

All shortcuts are fully customizable in settings.

### 7. Streaming and Context Management

- Answers stream in real-time token-by-token
- Conversation context maintained within a session
- Users can change direction, refine answers, or ask follow-ups naturally
- Session context is not persisted between application restarts (no persistent memory)

## AI Models and Backend

### Free Tier (Launch Offering)

Uses open-source models via Groq API for inference:

- **Chat**: Llama 3.3 70B via Groq
- **Vision/Screenshot Analysis**: Llama 4 Scout via Groq Vision
- **Voice Transcription**: Deepgram Nova-3

### Paid Tiers

Upgrade to OpenAI models for higher quality:

- **Chat**: GPT-4o
- **Voice Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper

**Configuration**: No API key setup required on any tier. All API keys and infrastructure are managed by Ghost Desk and abstracted from the user.

---

## Architecture and Technical Design

### Window Display Affinity Implementation

Ghost Desk uses the Windows SetWindowDisplayAffinity API to implement screen-share invisibility:

**Source mechanism** (quoted from FAQ): "GhostDesk uses the Windows SetWindowDisplayAffinity API to exclude its overlay from all screen-capture pipelines. This means any app that captures the screen — Zoom, Teams, OBS, Windows Game Bar — simply won't include the GhostDesk window. It's an OS-level privacy feature built into Windows."

The API function excludes the window from:
- Desktop Windows Manager (DWM) composition
- Screen capture pipelines used by recording software
- Video conference screen-sharing stacks
- Task managers and process enumerations

### Dual UI Architecture

Two rendering modes indicate layered application design:

- **Taskbar/persistent indicator**: Low-resource state
- **Full chat panel**: Rich UI for interaction

UI switching is instant and controlled by global hotkeys.

### Multimodal Processing Pipeline

The architecture processes three input types:

1. **Text input** → Chat model (Llama 3.3 or GPT-4o) → Streamed text response
2. **Voice input** → Transcription (Deepgram or Whisper) → Chat model → Voice synthesis output
3. **Screen region** → Vision model (Llama 4 Scout or GPT-4o Vision) → Chat model → Text/voice response

---

## Limitations and Caveats

### Platform Constraints

- **Windows-only**: No native support for macOS or Linux. The FAQ explicitly states "macOS and Linux versions are being explored but there is no release date yet."
- **Windows version minimum**: Requires Windows 10 build 19041 or later, or Windows 11. Earlier Windows versions cannot use Ghost Desk due to SetWindowDisplayAffinity API availability (introduced in Windows 7 but requires Desktop Windows Manager compositing on modern builds).
- **RAM requirement**: Minimum 4GB RAM specified; performance on lower-spec systems untested.

### Functionality Limitations

- **No persistent session memory**: Conversation context exists only within a single Ghost Desk session. When the application is restarted, conversation history is not retained.
- **Groq API rate limits** (free tier): Llama model inference via Groq is subject to Groq's API rate limits, which may affect high-frequency query usage.
- **Deepgram transcription limits**: Voice transcription is provided by Deepgram API; quality and speed depend on network connectivity and Deepgram service availability.
- **Screenshot scope**: Users must manually select the region to analyze; there is no automatic code detection or document boundary recognition.

### Documented Behavioral Notes

- **Legal responsibility**: The FAQ states "Whether its use is appropriate in a given context depends on your organization's policies. You are responsible for understanding and complying with any applicable rules." Ghost Desk is explicitly described as "similar to a sticky note app or a second monitor" — legal use depends on organizational policy and context.
- **No built-in privacy encryption**: The overlay communication is abstracted from the user, but no explicit statement about end-to-end encryption is made. Data sent to Groq and Deepgram APIs is subject to their privacy policies.

### Unsupported Features

- Persistent conversation history
- Multi-session context retention
- Offline operation (requires live Groq/Deepgram API access)
- macOS/Linux support
- Custom AI model loading

## Use Cases and Relevance to Claude Code Development

Ghost Desk is relevant to agents and developers in the following contexts:

### 1. Invisible Code Assistance During Live Development

Agents operating on a developer's screen during presentations or live coding sessions can maintain an AI copilot overlay that remains invisible to viewers. This enables real-time problem-solving during demonstrations without revealing the AI assistance.

### 2. Meeting Assistance Without Visual Distraction

During technical interviews, code reviews, or pair programming sessions conducted via video conference, an AI overlay can provide suggestions, code analysis, or documentation lookups without appearing on the shared screen.

### 3. Research and Context Gathering During Coding

The vision capabilities allow automated screenshot analysis of code or error messages, enabling agents to understand context without requiring manual prompt input. An agent could:
- Capture a stack trace and immediately receive error analysis
- Screenshot a class definition and request refactoring suggestions
- Capture a design mockup and generate implementation code

### 4. Privacy-Preserving Development Assistance

For developers working with sensitive codebases or proprietary systems, the overlay's screen-share invisibility ensures that AI assistance (and the model being used) does not leak information during client presentations or team demos.

### 5. AI Skill Development for Agents

The technical architecture (SetWindowDisplayAffinity, Groq/OpenAI backend abstraction, vision processing pipeline) provides a reference implementation for developers building AI-powered Windows overlays or invisible assistants.
