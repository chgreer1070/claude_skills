## Overview

Everything Claude Code (ECC) is an agent harness performance optimization system delivering 15 specialized sub-agents, 56+ skills, 33+ slash commands, a trigger-based hooks pipeline, multi-language rules, and MCP server configurations assembled over 10+ months of daily use. Originating as an Anthropic hackathon winner (Cerebral Valley x Anthropic, Feb 2026), it has reached 61K+ GitHub stars and 7.6K+ forks, making it the largest community-maintained Claude Code configuration library by engagement. As of v1.8.0 it repositions from "config bundle" to a practical agent harness performance system with reliable hooks, eval/quality controls, and tighter parity across five AI coding tools: Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex CLI, and Antigravity IDE.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No standard starting point for Claude Code configuration | Ready-to-install plugin with 15 agents, 56 skills, 33 commands, and a hooks pipeline immediately available |
| Claude Code lacks memory between sessions | `hooks/memory-persistence/` hooks save and reload context at session start/end automatically |
| Configuring MCP servers for GitHub, Supabase, Vercel, Railway requires manual JSON editing | `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` ships pre-configured server definitions for common services |
| Code quality is advisory rather than enforced when using AI | Rules directory provides always-follow guidelines; PostToolUse hooks enforce linting and testing |
| Token budget wasted on language-agnostic rules in single-language projects | Rules restructured into `common/` + `typescript/` + `python/` + `golang/` — install only what applies |
| AI coding agents lack domain-specific knowledge (ClickHouse, Django, Spring Boot, Swift) | 56+ skills covering analytics, backend, frontend, mobile, databases, deployment, and security |
| Claude Code configuration is not portable across teams | Plugin marketplace integration: one command installs the full config for any team member |
| AI sessions generate insights that are immediately lost | Continuous learning v2 (`/learn`, `/evolve`) extracts instincts from sessions into reusable skill files |
| Hooks are unreliable in CI and non-interactive environments | `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal\|standard\|strict` + `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS` env var for explicit hook control |
| Agent harness performance is not measurable or auditable | `/harness-audit` and `/quality-gate` commands baseline reliability and enforce quality controls |

### Hooks Pipeline

```text
hooks/hooks.json — JSON config with PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop event handlers
hooks/memory-persistence/
  session-start.js    — Load context from persistent storage at session start
  session-end.js      — Save state at session end
  pre-compact.js      — Snapshot active state before auto-compaction
  suggest-compact.js  — Strategic compaction timing suggestions
  evaluate-session.js — Auto-extract patterns from completed sessions
```

Hook environment controls (added v1.8.0):

- `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal|standard|strict` — tune hook aggressiveness
- `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS=comma,separated,ids` — disable specific hooks by ID

### Multi-Language Rules Architecture

Rules are split into four directories, allowing selective installation:

```text
rules/
  common/           — Language-agnostic (coding-style, git-workflow, testing, security, patterns, agents, hooks)
  typescript/       — TypeScript/JavaScript specific
  python/           — Python specific
  golang/           — Go specific
```

Install via `./install.sh typescript python golang` (the installer script handles merge/overwrite detection).

### NanoClaw v2 (added v1.8.0)

NanoClaw is ECC's persistent session-aware CLI REPL. v2 adds:

- Model routing — route tasks to the appropriate model based on complexity and cost
- Skill hot-load — load and reload skills without restarting the session
- Session branch/search/export/compact/metrics — full session lifecycle management

Exposed via the `nanoclaw-repl` skill and `/model-route` command.

### Continuous Learning v2 (Instinct System)

The instinct system automatically extracts patterns from sessions:

- Instincts stored with confidence scores, evidence, and example sessions
- `/instinct-status` surfaces high-confidence patterns for review
- `/evolve` clusters related instincts into generalized skills via LLM analysis
- Import/export enables team-wide pattern sharing
- `continuous-learning-v2/` skill documents the full lifecycle

### AgentShield Security Auditor

Built at the Claude Code Hackathon (Cerebral Valley x Anthropic, Feb 2026). Scans Claude Code configuration for vulnerabilities.

```bash
npx ecc-agentshield scan         # Quick scan
npx ecc-agentshield scan --fix   # Auto-fix safe issues
npx ecc-agentshield scan --opus  # Deep analysis with three Opus 4.6 agents
```

Scans: CLAUDE.md, settings.json, MCP configs, hooks, agents, skills across 5 categories — secrets detection (14 patterns), permission auditing, hook injection analysis, MCP server risk profiling, and agent config review. Output formats: terminal (A-F grade), JSON, Markdown, HTML. Exit code 2 on critical findings for CI build gates.

### Cross-Platform Support

All hooks and scripts written in Node.js. Supports Windows, macOS, Linux. Package manager detection priority: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER` env → `.claude/package-manager.json` → `package.json` `packageManager` field → lock file detection → global config → fallback to first available.

v1.8.0 hardened Windows path handling for doc-warning/whitelist logic and replaced fragile inline one-liner hook commands with dedicated scripts for safer cross-platform behavior.

### Multi-Tool Support (v1.8.0)

Single config source for five AI coding tools:

- **Claude Code** — native via plugin marketplace
- **Cursor** — `/.cursor/` directory with rules and agents
- **OpenCode** — `/.opencode/` with plugin system, 20+ hook event types, 3 native custom tools
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** — `/.codex/` via `/codex-setup` command generating `codex.md`
- **Antigravity IDE** — added in v1.8.0 (5th supported tool)

### GitHub Marketplace App

Available at `github.com/marketplace/ecc-tools`. Free/Pro/Enterprise tiers. Provides `/skill-creator analyze` via issue comments and auto-triggers on push to default branch. Generates SKILL.md files, instinct collections, and pattern extraction from commit history.

```

**Installation mechanism**: Claude Code v2.1+ auto-loads `hooks/hooks.json` from any installed plugin by convention. Explicitly declaring it in `plugin.json` causes a duplicate detection error — the repo enforces this via a regression test.

**Plugin installation**:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code
/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

Or manually add to `~/.claude/settings.json` under `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins`.

**Rules require manual copy** (upstream Claude Code plugin limitation — rules cannot be distributed via plugins):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git
./install.sh typescript    # or python or golang
```

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Direct Applicability

This repository is the closest peer project to `claude_skills` in the Claude Code ecosystem. Both organize configuration as plugins with agents, skills, commands, hooks, and rules. Reviewing ECC's structure surfaces patterns directly applicable to `claude_skills` development:

- **Continuous learning v2 (instinct system)**: Automatic session pattern extraction with confidence scoring and cluster-to-skill promotion — a novel architecture not present in `claude_skills` that could address the gap between ephemeral session knowledge and persistent skills.
- **Language-selective rules**: The `common/` + per-language directory split reduces context waste for single-language projects. `claude_skills` uses a flat rules structure.
- **Skill creator command (`/skill-create`)**: Generates SKILL.md files from git history via local analysis — a workflow that could complement `claude_skills`' `/plugin-creator:skill-creator`.
- **`contexts/` directory**: Dynamic system prompt injection modes (dev/review/research) provide lightweight context switching without separate skills or commands.
- **Real-world CLAUDE.md examples**: `examples/saas-nextjs-CLAUDE.md`, `examples/go-microservice-CLAUDE.md` etc. are concrete references for users setting up their own projects.
- **Hook reliability controls (v1.8.0)**: `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE` and `ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS` env vars are a concrete pattern for making hooks controllable in CI and non-interactive environments — directly applicable to `claude_skills` hooks.
- **Harness audit commands (v1.8.0)**: `/harness-audit` and `/quality-gate` commands address measurability of agent performance — a gap in `claude_skills`' current evaluation tooling.

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Blocking Stop hooks**: Prevent premature session end when a multi-phase workflow is in progress — applicable to `claude_skills` long-running agent workflows.
- **Pre/post-compact hooks**: `pre-compact.js` + session-start restore enables seamless continuation across context resets for any skill managing multi-phase state.
- **Regression test for plugin.json hooks field**: Auto-detecting a common misconfiguration (duplicate hooks declaration) via a test prevents repeated fix/revert cycles.
- **AgentShield scan in CI**: Running `npx ecc-agentshield scan` as a build gate (exit code 2 on critical findings) is a concrete security enforcement pattern for Claude Code plugin repositories.
- **Dedicated hook scripts (v1.8.0)**: Replacing inline one-liner hook commands with dedicated scripts reduces cross-platform failure modes — the pattern `claude_skills` should follow for any hook with conditional logic.

### Competitive Analysis

| Dimension | ECC (affaan-m) | claude_skills (this repo) |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Primary focus | Agent harness performance system (repositioned v1.8.0) | Modular skills marketplace with plugin framework |
| Distribution | Plugin marketplace + git clone | Plugin marketplace (Claude Code native) |
| Rules distribution | Manual copy via install.sh (upstream limitation) | Same upstream limitation |
| Learning system | Continuous learning v2 (instinct-based, auto-extract) | No built-in equivalent |
| Security tooling | AgentShield (102 rules, npm package, CI-ready) | No built-in equivalent |
| Cross-tool support | Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex CLI, Antigravity IDE | Claude Code only |
| Testing | 992 tests (Node.js) | Python-based validation scripts |
| Languages supported | JS, TS, Python, Go, C++, Java, Swift, Rust, Django | Language-agnostic |
| Stars at research | 61,784 | N/A (internal) |
| Agents | 15 | Varies by plugin |
| Skills | 56+ | Varies by plugin |
| License | MIT | Internal/proprietary |

### Integration Opportunities

- The `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` pre-configured MCP definitions (GitHub, Supabase, Vercel, Railway) are directly reusable as references when documenting MCP server configurations in `claude_skills`.
- ECC's `examples/` CLAUDE.md files for real-world stacks (SaaS Next.js, Go microservice, Django API, Rust API) are valuable research references for `claude_skills` documentation.
- The `/security-scan` skill wrapping AgentShield could be evaluated as a security audit step in `claude_skills` CI/pre-commit pipeline.
- ECC's `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE` pattern could be adapted for `claude_skills` hooks to allow per-environment tuning without code changes.
