## Overview

Kythe is a language-agnostic ecosystem for building tools that work with code, developed at Google to create semantic indices and cross-references for large, multi-language codebases. It provides a pluggable architecture with standardized protocols and data formats for representing source code information as graph data, enabling tools like editors, compilers, analyzers, and build systems to share semantic information smoothly across languages.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Tool integration requires O(L×C×B) work for L languages, C clients, B build systems | Hub-and-spoke model reduces integration to O(L+C+B) via language-agnostic protocols |
| Developers lose time adapting tools that re-solve already-solved problems | Standardized interchange format allows tools to share compiler metadata, cross-references, type information |
| IDE and analysis tools scale poorly across diverse languages and large codebases | Kythe runs language analysis and indexing as services with lightweight client composition |
| Forcing uniform toolchains reduces developer productivity | Language-agnostic graph structure enables any workable combination of tools to interoperate |
| Cross-language codebases lack unified semantic understanding | Extensible graph schema captures semantic information across all project languages |

## Key Features

### Language Support

- Indexers for C++, Go, and Java (open-source implementations)
- Compilation extractors for javac, Maven, cmake, Go, and Bazel
- Extensible architecture allows adding new language indexers
- Language-agnostic protocols enable cross-language semantic analysis

### Graph-Based Code Model

- Language-agnostic graph structure for build-system and compiler metadata
- Semantic cross-references: definitions, usages, type information, cross-language associations
- Extensible schema with custom node and edge types without central authority
- Liberal design allows tools to gracefully handle missing or incomplete data
- VName (Vector-Name) system for globally unique node identification

### Architecture Components

- **Extractors**: Capture compilation records from build systems
- **Indexers**: Analyze source code and emit semantic facts as graph entries
- **Graph Store**: Persistent storage in compact, portable format (storage tables in 1NF)
- **Serving Layer**: Efficient denormalized representations for UI-facing services
- **Verifier**: Generic tool for validating indexer outputs against expected schema

### Service-Oriented Design

- Analysis and indexing run as services, not monolithic tools
- Thin client composition enables lightweight editor and IDE integration
- Sharded storage and scanning for horizontal scalability
- Separation of storage (compact) and serving (query-optimized) representations

### Interoperability Principles

- Partial information preferred over none (graceful degradation)
- Incomplete data preferred over incorrect data
- Tools adjust to missing data rather than failing completely
- Hub model reduces combinatorial integration complexity

## Technical Architecture

Kythe's architecture follows a multi-stage pipeline:

**Extraction Phase**:
Build system integration captures compilation units with source files, compiler flags, and dependencies as extraction records.

**Indexing Phase**:
Language-specific indexers analyze compilation records and emit semantic facts as graph entries (nodes and edges). Each fact represents atomic semantic information (definitions, references, types, relationships).

**Storage Phase**:
Graph store persists entries in normalized tabular format optimized for compactness and portability. Storage format is simple (1NF records), toolchain-neutral, and convertible between backends (LevelDB, CSV, SQLite, Cloud Datastore).

**Serving Phase**:
Storage data is processed into denormalized, query-optimized formats for efficient cross-reference lookups, call graphs, type hierarchies, and code navigation in client tools.

**Graph Schema**:
All nodes identified by VNames (corpus, root, path, language, signature). Facts stored as key-value pairs. Edges represent relationships (child-of, ref, defines, typed-as). Schema is extensible with custom node kinds and edge types.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Download latest release
wget https://github.com/kythe/kythe/releases/latest/download/kythe-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
tar xzf kythe-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
sudo mv kythe-vX.Y.Z/ /opt/kythe
```

```bash
# Extract compilation records (example with Bazel)
bazel build --experimental_action_listener=//kythe/extractors:extract_kzip //my:target

# Index extracted compilation
kythe/indexers/cxx_indexer --index_file compilation.kzip > entries

# Store graph entries
kythe write_entries --graphstore=/tmp/gs < entries

# Serve cross-references
kythe http_server --graphstore=/tmp/gs --listen=:8080
```

```bash
# Query semantic graph
kythe xrefs --graphstore=/tmp/gs --signature="java.lang.String#length()"
```

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- **Code Intelligence Foundation**: Kythe's graph-based semantic model provides richer code understanding than LSP, capturing cross-language relationships and build-time information
- **Multi-Language Projects**: Claude Code plugin system spans JavaScript, Python, Bash—Kythe's language-agnostic protocols could unify semantic understanding across skill implementations
- **Scalable Analysis**: Service-oriented architecture pattern applicable to Claude Code's agent orchestration and skill composition
- **Offline Indexing**: Separation of indexing (expensive) from serving (fast) aligns with Claude's need to balance context gathering with response latency

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Hub-and-Spoke Integration Model**: Reduce O(N×M) tool integration to O(N+M) via standardized interchange formats—applicable to skill/agent/tool composition
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design tools to function with partial information rather than failing on incomplete data—critical for AI agents handling real-world codebases
- **Extensible Schema Without Central Authority**: Allow plugins and skills to extend metadata schema without coordinating changes across all components
- **Separation of Storage and Serving**: Optimize storage for compactness/portability, serving for query performance—applicable to skill knowledge bases and context management
- **Incomplete Over Incorrect**: Prefer emitting partial results over fabricating complete but wrong data—aligns with AI agent hallucination prevention

### Integration Opportunities

- **MCP Server for Kythe**: Build Model Context Protocol server exposing Kythe graph queries to Claude Code for semantic code navigation beyond LSP capabilities
- **Skill Indexing**: Apply Kythe's graph model to index skill dependencies, reference relationships, and cross-skill semantic patterns for orchestrator decision-making
- **Build Integration**: Use Kythe extractors to capture compilation metadata from user projects, providing Claude Code with build-aware code understanding
- **Cross-Reference Service**: Deploy Kythe serving layer as background service for deep code analysis tasks where LSP lacks sufficient semantic depth
- **Agent Knowledge Graphs**: Adapt Kythe's VName and fact storage patterns for representing agent knowledge, task dependencies, and multi-agent coordination state
