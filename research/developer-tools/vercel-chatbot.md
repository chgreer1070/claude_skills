## Overview

Vercel Chatbot (formerly AI Chatbot) is an open-source, production-ready Next.js 16 template for building full-featured AI chatbot applications. It serves as Vercel's official reference implementation for the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) and the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway), providing a complete end-to-end chatbot architecture with authentication, persistent chat history, multi-model support, artifact generation, file uploads, and resumable streaming. The project is marked as a GitHub template repository (`is_template: true`), designed to be forked and deployed with one click to Vercel.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Starting a production chatbot from scratch requires weeks of boilerplate | Ready-to-deploy Next.js template with all infrastructure wired up |
| Multi-provider LLM integration is repetitive and fragile | Unified Vercel AI Gateway routes all models through a single interface |
| Chat history persistence requires custom backend work | Neon Serverless Postgres + Drizzle ORM schema provided and migrated automatically |
| Resumable streaming is hard to implement correctly | `resumable-stream` library + `Stream` table in DB enables mid-response resumption |
| File and image handling requires separate storage setup | Vercel Blob integration for attachment uploads |
| Authentication for chatbots requires custom session handling | Auth.js (NextAuth v5) with guest and regular user types |
| Generative documents alongside chat is complex | Artifact system with text, code, image, and sheet artifact types |
| Reasoning model output needs special parsing | `extractReasoningMiddleware` wraps any model to surface `<thinking>` tokens |

## Key Features

### Multi-Model Support via AI Gateway

The template uses the `@ai-sdk/gateway` package to route all LLM requests through the Vercel AI Gateway, providing a single authentication surface for multiple providers. Supported models in the default configuration include:

- **Anthropic**: Claude Haiku 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, Claude 3.7 Sonnet (reasoning)
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4.1 Mini, GPT-5.2
- **Google**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (default), Gemini 3 Pro
- **xAI**: Grok 4.1 Fast, Grok Code Fast (reasoning)
- **Title model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (dedicated lightweight model)
- **Artifact model**: Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 (dedicated artifact generation model)

SOURCE: `lib/ai/models.ts` and `lib/ai/providers.ts` in repository (accessed 2026-02-26)

### Artifact System

A structured document generation system with four artifact types, each with a client renderer and server handler:

- **Text** (`artifacts/text/`): ProseMirror-based rich text editor with AI-driven suggestions and diffs
- **Code** (`artifacts/code/`): CodeMirror 6 editor supporting JavaScript and Python with syntax highlighting
- **Image** (`artifacts/image/`): AI-generated image artifacts with display component
- **Sheet** (`artifacts/sheet/`): `react-data-grid` spreadsheet with PapaParse CSV support

Each artifact type implements `onCreateDocument` and `onUpdateDocument` handlers using `streamObject` from the AI SDK, streaming structured output directly into the document via a `dataStream`.

### Resumable Streaming

The template implements stream resumption so users can close and reopen the browser mid-generation without losing the response. The architecture uses:

- `resumable-stream` npm package for server-side stream state
- `Stream` table in PostgreSQL recording active stream IDs per chat
- `/api/chat/[id]/stream` route for reconnecting to in-progress streams
- `useAutoResume` hook on the client to detect and resume incomplete messages

### Authentication with User Tiers

Auth.js (NextAuth v5 beta) handles authentication with two user types and rate limiting:

| User Type | Max Messages / 24h |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `guest` | 20 |
| `regular` | 50 |

Guest users are created via `/api/auth/guest` with a server-side session. Regular users register with email + bcrypt-hashed password stored in PostgreSQL.

### Message Voting and Chat Visibility

- Per-message upvote/downvote stored in `Vote_v2` table linked to `Message_v2`
- Chat visibility toggle: `public` or `private` per conversation
- Chat sharing allows public chats to be viewed without authentication

### File Upload and Attachments

- File uploads handled at `/api/files/upload` route
- Files stored in Vercel Blob (`@vercel/blob`)
- Multimodal input component (`components/multimodal-input.tsx`) with attachment preview

### Observability

- OpenTelemetry instrumentation via `@vercel/otel` and `@opentelemetry/api`
- `instrumentation.ts` registers the OTEL provider for Next.js instrumentation hook
- Vercel Analytics integrated via `@vercel/analytics`

Chat         id, createdAt, title, userId, visibility (public/private)
Message_v2   id, chatId, role, parts (json), attachments (json), createdAt
Vote_v2      chatId + messageId (composite PK), isUpvoted

### AI SDK Version

The template uses AI SDK v6 (`ai: 6.0.37`, `@ai-sdk/react: 3.0.39`, `@ai-sdk/gateway: ^3.0.15`). This is a major version of the Vercel AI SDK with changes to the message format (parts-based messages in `Message_v2`, migration guide referenced in schema deprecation comments).

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI and link project
npm i -g vercel
vercel link

# 2. Pull environment variables
vercel env pull

# 3. Install dependencies and run migrations
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate

# 4. Start development server
pnpm dev
```

For non-Vercel deployment, set `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` in `.env.local` to authenticate with the Vercel AI Gateway. Alternatively, replace `@ai-sdk/gateway` with a direct provider package (`@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, etc.) by modifying `lib/ai/providers.ts`.

```bash
# Key environment variables (from .env.example)
# AUTH_SECRET=           — NextAuth secret
# POSTGRES_URL=          — Neon connection string
# BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN= — Vercel Blob token
# AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=    — For non-Vercel deployments only
```

### One-Click Vercel Deploy

```text

```

The Vercel template integration provisions Neon Postgres, Vercel Blob, and environment variables automatically.

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Direct Model Support

The `lib/ai/models.ts` file lists Claude Haiku 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Claude Opus 4.5 as first-class supported models alongside OpenAI and Google. Claude Haiku 4.5 is the dedicated artifact generation model (`getArtifactModel()`), making this a direct reference implementation for Claude-powered document generation.

### Artifact System as Agent Tool Pattern

The artifact architecture (`onCreateDocument` / `onUpdateDocument` handlers) mirrors the tool-use pattern in Claude Code: a structured schema is passed to `streamObject`, and the model streams JSON output matching the schema. This pattern is directly applicable to building Claude Code skills that generate structured artifacts.

### Resumable Streaming Reference

The `resumable-stream` integration solves the same problem that long-running Claude Code agent tasks face — what happens if the connection drops. The `Stream` table + resume route pattern is a concrete implementation worth studying for any agentic web UI.

### AI SDK v6 Patterns

The template uses `createUIMessageStream`, `convertToModelMessages`, and parts-based message format from AI SDK v6 — the current version of the SDK. Reviewing the chat route (`app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`) provides working examples of multi-turn conversation, tool call routing, rate limiting, and message persistence patterns.

### Reasoning Model Integration

The `extractReasoningMiddleware` wrapper for `wrapLanguageModel` shows how to surface chain-of-thought tokens from models that use `<thinking>` tags (Claude 3.7 Sonnet extended thinking, xAI Grok). This is relevant for any application displaying agent reasoning steps.

### Multi-Tier User Entitlements

The `entitlements.ts` pattern (per-user-type rate limits stored as config) is a clean, extensible approach for adding usage quotas to any Claude-powered product — applicable to Claude Code skill access controls.
