## Overview

Lopaka is an open-source web-based graphics editor specifically designed for creating pixel-perfect graphics for embedded systems displays. It generates ready-to-use C/C++ code for popular embedded graphics libraries including TFT_eSPI, U8g2, AdafruitGFX, and FlipperZero, enabling developers to design UI graphics visually and export them as uint8/uint32 variables without manual bitmap conversion.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Manual bitmap conversion for embedded displays is tedious and error-prone | Visual editor with automatic code generation for multiple graphics libraries |
| No unified tool supporting multiple embedded graphics frameworks | Single editor supporting TFT_eSPI, U8g2, AdafruitGFX, FlipperZero, M5GFX, LovyanGFX, and others |
| Difficult to preview graphics on embedded devices during development | FlipperZero live preview and multiple zoom scales for testing different screen sizes |
| Converting images to embedded-compatible formats requires manual processing | Drag-and-drop image import with automatic conversion to XBMP and C/C++ arrays |
| Designing pixel-perfect graphics for small screens (128x64, 240x320) is challenging | Pixel-perfect editor with various screen size presets and drawing tools |

### Platform Support

- **TFT_eSPI** - Popular ESP32/STM32 graphics library
- **U8g2** - Universal monochrome graphics library
- **AdafruitGFX** - Adafruit's graphics library
- **FlipperZero** - With live preview support
- **Inkplate** - E-paper displays
- **Watchy** - E-paper smartwatch
- **M5GFX** - M5Stack graphics library
- **LovyanGFX** - High-performance graphics library

### Developer Experience

- Web-based (no installation required via lopaka.app)
- No registration required
- Docker and pnpm local installation options
- Platform-specific display lists for FlipperZero and Inkplate
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Two color options for monochrome displays (black/white)

## Technical Architecture

Lopaka is built as a web application using modern frontend technologies:

**Frontend Stack**:
- Vue.js 3 for reactive UI components
- Vite as the build tool for fast development
- Canvas API for pixel-perfect drawing operations
- Component-based architecture for editor tools

**Deployment**:
- Cloud version hosted on CloudFlare Pages (lopaka.app)
- Self-hosted via Docker Compose or pnpm
- Static site generation for offline usage

**Code Generation Pipeline**:
1. User creates graphics using visual editor
2. Layer data stored in internal representation
3. Export triggers platform-specific code generator
4. Outputs optimized C/C++ arrays and initialization code
5. Generated code includes proper header includes and data structures

**Supported Output Formats**:
- uint8_t arrays for monochrome displays
- uint32_t arrays for color displays
- XBMP format for cross-platform compatibility
- Platform-specific initialization code

## Installation & Usage

### Cloud Usage (No Installation)

```text
Visit https://lopaka.app
Start designing immediately with no registration
```

### Local Installation - Docker

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sbrin/lopaka.git
cd lopaka

# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Access at http://localhost:5173
```

### Local Installation - pnpm

```bash
# Install pnpm if not available
npm install -g pnpm

# Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/sbrin/lopaka.git
cd lopaka
pnpm install

# Development server
pnpm dev

# Production build
pnpm build
```

### Basic Workflow

```text
1. Select target platform (TFT_eSPI, U8g2, AdafruitGFX, etc.)
2. Choose screen size or enter custom dimensions
3. Use drawing tools to create graphics:
   - Draw shapes (rectangle, circle, line)
   - Add text with supported fonts
   - Import images via drag-and-drop
   - Create layers and organize elements
4. Generate code using platform-specific export
5. Copy generated C/C++ code into Arduino/ESP32/STM32 project
6. Include necessary graphics library headers
7. Compile and flash to embedded device
```

### Example Generated Code (TFT_eSPI)

```cpp
// Auto-generated by Lopaka
#include <TFT_eSPI.h>

const uint8_t myIcon[] = {
  0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0x00, 0x18, 0x18, 0x00, 0x00, 0x18, 0x18, 0x00,
  // ... bitmap data
};

void drawIcon(TFT_eSPI &tft, int x, int y) {
  tft.drawBitmap(x, y, myIcon, 16, 16, TFT_WHITE);
}
```

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- **Developer tooling research**: Lopaka exemplifies domain-specific visual tooling that bridges design and code generation for specialized platforms
- **Code generation patterns**: Study how Lopaka generates platform-specific output from visual input for Claude Code code generation features
- **Web-based tooling**: Reference for building browser-based developer tools that require no installation
- **Multi-platform abstraction**: Learn from Lopaka's approach to supporting multiple embedded graphics libraries with a unified interface

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Visual-to-code workflow**: Transform visual designs into ready-to-use code, reducing manual translation errors
- **Platform-specific code generation**: Single source of truth (visual design) generates optimized code for multiple target platforms
- **No-registration cloud deployment**: Immediate accessibility via CloudFlare Pages without user barriers
- **Layer-based composition**: Organize complex designs into manageable layers with locking and alignment features
- **Inline editing**: Double-click to edit images directly within the canvas without external tools
- **Context preservation**: Importing code doesn't erase existing work, enabling iterative development

### Integration Opportunities

- **MCP server for embedded graphics**: Create MCP server that uses Lopaka's code generation patterns for embedded UI development assistance
- **Code-to-visual reverse engineering**: Integrate Lopaka-like visualization for understanding existing embedded graphics code
- **Template library**: Build reusable UI component library for common embedded display patterns (menus, icons, status bars)
- **AI-assisted design**: Use Claude Code to suggest optimal layouts for specific screen dimensions and use cases
- **Documentation generation**: Automatically document embedded UI components with screenshots and generated code examples
