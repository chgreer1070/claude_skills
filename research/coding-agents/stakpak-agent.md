---

## Architecture

Stakpak is structured as a monolithic Rust workspace with separate subsystems:

### Workspace Organization

```

### Execution Flow

1. **Configuration** → User sets profiles in `~/.stakpak/config.toml` (LLM provider, tools, system prompt)
2. **Authentication** → Provider credentials loaded from config or environment variables
3. **Agent Loop** → User input → context reduction → LLM call → tool execution → streaming response
4. **Tool Execution** → Tools run with secret substitution enabled (credentials stay encrypted)
5. **Output** → Real-time streaming to TUI or async mode

### Message Pipeline

User input → `Vec<ChatMessage>` → `ContextManager::reduce_context()` → `Vec<LLMMessage>` → Provider-specific format → LLM API call

---

## Key Features

### 1. Security-Hardened Architecture

- **Secret Substitution**: LLM receives variable references, not actual credentials. Agent resolves placeholders at execution time.
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**: Encrypted communication between MCP client and server by default.
- **Warden Guardrails**: Network-level policies block destructive operations before they execute.
- **Secure Password Generation**: Cryptographically secure password creation with configurable complexity rules.
- **Privacy Mode**: Redacts IP addresses, AWS account IDs, and other sensitive metadata from logs and outputs.

### 2. 24/7 Autonomous Runtime (Autopilot)

Stakpak runs as a system service (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux) with persistent scheduling and messaging:

- **Cron-Based Schedules**: Define recurring agent tasks with standard cron syntax.
- **Messaging Channels**: Slack, Telegram, Discord integration for notifications and command input.
- **Unified Configuration**: Single `~/.stakpak/autopilot.toml` file manages all schedules and channels.
- **Preflight Checks**: `stakpak autopilot doctor` validates system readiness before startup.

Commands:
```
stakpak up                      # Start autopilot
stakpak down                    # Stop autopilot
stakpak autopilot status        # View runtime health
stakpak autopilot logs          # Stream logs
stakpak autopilot schedule add  # Create new schedule
stakpak autopilot channel add   # Register messaging channel
```

### 3. Infrastructure Code Indexing & Search

- Automatic local indexing of Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions workflows
- Semantic search across indexed infrastructure code
- Context-aware code generation based on existing patterns

### 4. Real-Time Progress Streaming

Long-running operations (Docker builds, Helm deployments, Terraform applies) stream progress updates in real-time instead of blocking on completion.

### 5. DevOps Knowledge (Rulebooks)

Customizable rulebooks define organizational SOPs, playbooks, and deployment procedures:

```bash
stakpak rb get                                    # List rulebooks
stakpak rb apply my-org/deployment-guide.md      # Register a rulebook
stakpak rb delete stakpak://my-org/old-guide.md  # Remove rulebook
```

Rulebooks are markdown files with YAML frontmatter, providing context-specific guidance to the agent.

### 6. Asynchronous Task Management

Background command support for port forwarding, local servers, and long-running processes with proper tracking and cancellation.

### 7. Reversible File Operations

All file modifications are automatically backed up, enabling rollback recovery if changes prove problematic.

### 8. Bulk Message Approval

Approve multiple tool calls at once for efficient workflow execution instead of individual confirmations.

### 9. Editor Integration (Agent Client Protocol)

Zed editor integration via ACP allows:
- Real-time AI chat with context-aware assistance
- Live code analysis and modification
- Tool execution from within the editor
- Session persistence across editor restarts

## LLM Provider Support

Stakpak abstracts LLM providers behind a unified interface, supporting:

1. **Stakpak Managed** (remote): Requires Stakpak API key (no card for trial)
2. **Anthropic**: Claude models via Anthropic API
3. **OpenAI**: GPT models via OpenAI API
4. **Gemini**: Google Gemini models
5. **Custom OpenAI-Compatible**: Local endpoints (Ollama, LM Studio) or custom inference servers

Configuration via `~/.stakpak/config.toml` with provider-prefixed model names:
```toml
model = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
model = "openai/gpt-4"
model = "gemini/gemini-2.0-flash"
model = "offline/qwen/qwen3-coder-30b"  # Custom provider
```

---

## MCP Integration

Stakpak operates as both an MCP client and server:

### MCP Server Modes
- **Local** (`--tool-mode local`): File operations and command execution (no API key required)
- **Remote** (`--tool-mode remote`): AI-powered code generation and search tools (API key required)
- **Combined** (`--tool-mode combined`): Both local and remote tools (default)

### MCP Proxy
Multiplexes connections to multiple upstream MCP servers with unified configuration and secret redaction.

---

## Context Management & History Reduction

Stakpak implements multiple context reduction strategies for long conversations:

1. **Task Board Context Manager**: Preserves individual messages with semantic threading
2. **Simple Context Manager**: Flattens conversation history to summary text
3. **File Scratchpad Manager**: Maintains working notes in a temporary scratchpad file

Reduction is budget-aware—when conversation exceeds the LLM's context window threshold, the agent automatically trims history while preserving recent interactions and key context.

---

## Limitations & Caveats

- **Autopilot System Requirements**: Requires Docker to be installed and accessible to the current user; 2GB+ RAM recommended for reliable autopilot + sandbox execution; Linux user services may require linger to survive logout.
- **TTY Requirement**: Interactive TUI mode requires a terminal. Headless/async modes work in non-TTY environments.
- **Credential Management**: While secrets are substituted at execution time, they must be available in the local environment or config file — Stakpak does not manage credential storage beyond what the OS provides.
- **Network Access**: Tool operations (git, docker, API calls) require network access from the agent's execution context. Firewalled environments may require proxy configuration.
- **mTLS Certificate Management**: Default mTLS uses auto-generated certificates valid for local connections only; production deployments should use custom certificate chains.

---

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

**High relevance** — Stakpak demonstrates several patterns applicable to Claude Code agent work:

1. **Multi-Provider LLM Abstraction**: Template for unified LLM provider interface supporting multiple backends (Anthropic, OpenAI, custom)
2. **Security-First Credential Handling**: Secret substitution pattern ensures sensitive data never enters the LLM context
3. **Message Context Management**: Reusable context reduction strategies for long-running conversations
4. **Autonomous Scheduling**: 24/7 task execution model suitable for background agents
5. **DevOps Knowledge Encoding**: Rulebook approach for encoding organizational procedures and SOPs
6. **MCP Integration**: Reference implementation of MCP client/server with security hardening
7. **Editor Integration**: ACP protocol for embedding agents in code editors
8. **Real-Time Progress Streaming**: Pattern for streaming long-running operation updates without blocking

## Repository Structure Notes

The agent uses a modular Rust workspace with clear separation of concerns:
- CLI binaries (`cli/`) and TUI (`tui/`) are user-facing
- Libraries (`libs/`) are internal and versioned together
- Configuration is file-based (`~/.stakpak/config.toml`, `~/.stakpak/autopilot.toml`)
- Docker image uses aqua for lazy-loading CLI tools (reduces image from ~2GB to ~600MB)
- Dockerfile target: Rust 1.91.0 (slim), runtime: Python 3.13 with Docker CLI and cloud tooling
