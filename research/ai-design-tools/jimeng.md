## Overview

Jimeng AI (即梦AI) is ByteDance's AI-powered video and image generation platform, built on the SeedDance 2.0 multimodal model. It accepts text, images, video, and audio as inputs to generate cinematic-quality video content with precise camera controls (dolly-in, orbit, crane shot). Originally a China-only platform, the underlying SeedDance 2.0 model is also accessible internationally via third-party providers such as WaveSpeed.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Creating professional product demo videos requires weeks in After Effects or a motion designer | Jimeng generates floating, orbiting, cinematic product clips from a single screenshot and one-sentence prompt in 30–90 seconds |
| AI video tools generate random camera motion with no directorial control | SeedDance 2.0 understands specific camera verbs (dolly-in, orbit, crane shot) and executes them precisely for the full clip duration |
| App developers lack visual assets to promote their product | 1080p cinematic output from app screenshots requires no design skills and no video editing tools |
| Chinese AI tools require a VPN, Chinese phone number, and Alipay | The SeedDance 2.0 model is available internationally via WaveSpeed (wavespeed.ai) with English UI and Stripe payment |
| Maintaining UI fidelity when animating a screenshot is error-prone | Multimodal image-reference mode preserves brand colors, layout, and logos while only adding motion and camera moves |

## Key Features

### Cinematic Camera Control

- Understands natural-language camera verbs: dolly-in, orbit, crane shot, wide shot, close-up
- Camera motion is sustained and consistent for the full clip duration (no random mid-shot reframing)
- Subject-Action-Camera-Style prompt structure produces predictable, repeatable results

### Multimodal Input Pipeline

- Accepts up to four input types simultaneously: images, video (motion reference), audio (beat/rhythm sync), and text
- Images control visual identity (UI, brand colors, logo)
- Video reference controls motion style and camera path
- Audio input synchronizes cuts and motion pacing to beat
- Text fills remaining parameters (style, constraints, specific camera verbs)

### Image Reference Mode

- Tagged image references (`@Image1`, `@Image2`) tell the model which assets to animate vs. use as environment
- Preserves UI fidelity — does not redesign or alter uploaded screenshots
- Supports multiple image layers combined in a single generation

### AI Image Generation and Editing

- Text-to-image and image-to-image generation
- Smart canvas with multi-layer editing
- Inpainting (local redraw), background replacement, style transfer, pose preservation
- One-click outpainting (expand canvas in any direction)
- Object removal and image segmentation

### First-Frame / Last-Frame Control

- Specify exact start and end frames to constrain the motion arc
- Increases controllability for sequences requiring precise transitions

### Output Quality

- Up to 1080p resolution video output
- Recommended clip duration: 8–12 seconds (longer clips lose coherence)
- Aspect ratio options: 16:9 (Twitter/X), 9:16 (Reels/TikTok)

## Technical Architecture

SeedDance 2.0 is ByteDance's multimodal video generation model. Key architectural characteristics:

- **Multimodal conditioning**: simultaneous conditioning on image, video, audio, and text modalities
- **Camera-aware generation**: trained to respond to cinematography terminology as control signals
- **Reference preservation**: image-reference mode separates content identity (what to show) from motion (how to animate), avoiding layout hallucination
- **Cloud inference**: all generation happens server-side; no local hardware requirements
- **Deployment options**: native via Jimeng portal (Chinese account required) or via third-party API providers (WaveSpeed, Seedance2.tech)

## Installation & Usage

<eg>
No installation required - web-based platform
</eg>

**Option A — Jimeng portal (full features, requires Chinese account):**

<eg>
1. Visit https://jimeng.jianying.com
2. Sign in with a Chinese phone number
3. Select AI Video or AI Image tool
4. Upload reference image(s)
5. Enter prompt using Subject → Action → Camera → Style → Constraints structure
6. Set resolution (1080p), duration (8–12 s), aspect ratio
7. Generate and download
</eg>

**Option B — WaveSpeed (international, English UI, Stripe payment):**

<eg>
1. Visit https://wavespeed.ai
2. Create account, add credits (~$0.50/generation)
3. Select SeedDance 2.0 model
4. Choose "All-Round Reference" or "Universal Reference" mode
5. Upload image(s) — system tags them as @Image1, @Image2 automatically
6. Enter prompt (leave @Image tags in place)
7. Generate
</eg>

**Prompt template for app demos:**

<eg>
[UI element] @Image1 [position], [what moves], [camera move], [lighting/style], [constraints]

Example:
App interface @Image1 centered in frame, icons and UI cards gently floating and
orbiting around the main screen, slow continuous dolly-in for the full 8 seconds,
soft neon rim light and dark gradient background with subtle particle trails,
no extra logos, keep brand colors exactly, no text overlays.
</eg>

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- Generate cinematic demo clips for Claude Code plugins and skills from simple UI screenshots
- Create short-form promotional content for marketplace plugins without hiring a motion designer
- Automate product demo asset creation as part of a release workflow

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Subject-Action-Camera-Style-Constraints prompt structure**: a transferable pattern for structured AI prompting that produces deterministic, reproducible outputs — applicable to any prompt engineering task
- **Multimodal reference separation**: treating each input modality as a distinct control channel (identity, motion, rhythm, style) is a strong architectural pattern for multi-input AI tools
- **Constraint-first generation**: explicitly listing what the model must NOT change (brand colors, text, layout) often produces more stable outputs than only describing what it should do

### Integration Opportunities

- MCP server wrapping the WaveSpeed API to expose SeedDance 2.0 video generation to Claude Code agentic workflows
- Claude Code skill for automated product demo generation: screenshot → prompt construction → SeedDance generation → output asset
- Batch demo generation pipeline for releasing multiple plugin previews simultaneously
