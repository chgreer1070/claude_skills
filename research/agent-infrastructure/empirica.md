# Empirica — AI Epistemic Measurement & Calibration Infrastructure

## Overview

Empirica is an open-source **measurement and calibration layer for AI agents**, designed to address fundamental reliability issues in autonomous AI work: uncertainty tracking, pre-action understanding validation, knowledge persistence across sessions, and grounded confidence assessment.

**Problem statement**: "AI coding agents today have no self-awareness about what they know" — they forget between sessions, act before understanding, cannot distinguish knowledge from confabulation, and leave no audit trail of reasoning. Empirica solves this through epistemic transactions, gating mechanisms, multi-layer memory, and calibration against ground truth.

**Primary use case**: Enhance Claude Code's native capabilities with measurement, gating, and learning feedback. Also available for Cursor, Cline, Copilot, Gemini, Qwen, Roo Code, and any AI via CLI + system prompt.

**Identity**: Version 1.7.7 (released 2026-04-01 per GitHub commit history), MIT License, authored by David S. L. Van Assche. 204 GitHub stars, 24 forks. Written in Python (>=3.10).

## Problem Addressed

Empirica targets specific, measurable failures in AI agent autonomy:

| Failure Mode | Empirica Solution |
|---|---|
| **Forgets between sessions** | 4-layer memory system with persistent storage, cross-session artifact retrieval, BREADCRUMBS git notes |
| **Acts before understanding** | Sentinel gate between noetic (investigation) and praxic (action) phases; blocks edits until understanding is verified |
| **Cannot tell when guessing** | 13-vector epistemic framework differentiates knowledge state from uncertainty; explicit doubt tracking |
| **No audit trail** | Complete transaction logging (PREFLIGHT→CHECK→POSTFLIGHT), findings/unknowns/dead-ends stored in `.empirica/` SQLite + qdrant |

## Key Features

### 1. Sentinel Gate — Epistemic Readiness Gating

**What it does**: The Sentinel is a governance layer that controls the transition between investigation (noetic) and action (praxic) phases. Before the AI is permitted to edit code, it must demonstrate understanding through the Sentinel gate.

**Mechanism**: The CHECK phase compares epistemic vectors against dynamic thresholds. If vectors meet calibrated thresholds, the gate PROCEEDS; if insufficient understanding, the gate forces INVESTIGATE. The decision is reversible — the AI can loop through investigation phases, accumulating evidence, until ready.

**Configuration**: Sentinel has an "allow list" of always-permitted noetic tools (ToolSearch, git notes, intelligence layer MCP) and blocks praxic tools during investigation. Closed transactions allow safe noetic tools without requiring a new PREFLIGHT. Access: `sentinel-gate.py` module, configurable via `EMPIRICA_SENTINEL_LOOPING` and `EMPIRICA_AUTOPILOT` environment variables.

Source: README.md §How It Works With Claude Code (line 218); SENTINEL_ARCHITECTURE.md, lines 1–40; CHANGELOG.md [1.7.7] "Sentinel closed-transaction noetic check"; CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md.

### 2. Epistemic Transaction Workflow — PREFLIGHT→CHECK→POSTFLIGHT

**What it does**: Every goal or task runs through a three-phase epistemic cycle. Each phase measures the AI's epistemic state (knowledge, confidence, understanding) and gates transitions.

**Mechanism**:
- **PREFLIGHT**: Baseline assessment. AI states what it knows before starting. Records initial values of all 13 epistemic vectors.
- **CHECK**: Sentinel gate transition. Vectors are re-assessed. If all meet thresholds (computed from calibration data), proceed to action. Otherwise, loop back to PREFLIGHT with new investigation instructions.
- **POSTFLIGHT**: Learning measurement. After completing work, AI measures what it learned — computing a delta between preflight and postflight vectors. This delta persists to memory and feeds calibration.

**Storage**: Transactions are logged in `.empirica/sessions.db` (SQLite). Each transaction records findings, unknowns, dead-ends, vector values, confidence, and outcomes.

Source: README.md §The Epistemic Transaction Cycle (lines 150–165); EPISTEMIC_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md, lines 1–50; MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md, lines 90–100+.

### 3. The 13 Epistemic Vectors — Multidimensional Knowledge Measurement

**What it does**: Empirica measures AI knowledge and state using 13 dimensions (vectors) that emerged from 600+ real working sessions. These dimensions predict success or failure in complex agent tasks.

**The vectors** (organized by tier):

| Tier | Vector | Measures |
|------|--------|----------|
| Gate | `engagement` | Is the AI actively processing or disengaged? |
| Foundation | `know` | Domain knowledge depth |
| | `do` | Execution capability |
| | `context` | Access to relevant information |
| Comprehension | `clarity` | How clear is the understanding? |
| | `coherence` | Do the pieces fit together? |
| | `signal` | Signal-to-noise in available information |
| | `density` | Information richness |
| Execution | `state` | Current working state |
| | `change` | Rate of progress/change |
| | `completion` | Task completion level |
| | `impact` | Significance of the work |
| Meta | `uncertainty` | Explicit doubt tracking |

**Real-time display**: When Claude Code hooks are enabled, a statusline shows epistemic state: `[empirica] ⚡94% ↕70% │ 🎯3 │ POST 🔍92% │ K:95% C:92% │ Δ +K +C` where ⚡ is overall confidence, ↕ is Sentinel threshold, 🎯 is open goals, POST is phase + work state, K/C are knowledge/context vectors, Δ is learning delta.

Source: README.md §The 13 Epistemic Vectors (lines 187–206); §Live Statusline (lines 168–184).

### 4. Four-Layer Memory Architecture — Persistence Across Sessions

**What it does**: Empirica maintains a 4-tier memory system that survives context compaction, session boundaries, and repository transfers. The AI can query this memory to bootstrap understanding in a new session.

**The tiers** (from always-loaded to persistent-storage):

1. **TIER 1 (ALWAYS LOADED)**: System prompt with vector definitions, MEMORY.md (auto-curated 200-line index), hook output (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit)
2. **TIER 2 (ON-DEMAND)**: Individual memory files, .breadcrumbs.yaml (calibration corrections), Qdrant search (eidetic/episodic), project-bootstrap output
3. **TIER 3 (PERSISTENT STORAGE)**: sessions.db (goals, artifacts, calibration), workspace.db (cross-project registry), Qdrant collections, Git notes --ref=breadcrumbs
4. **TIER 4 (TRANSIENT)**: Per-session instance files, active work metadata, transaction state (ephemeral, auto-cleaned)

**Auto-curation**: MEMORY.md is automatically maintained at ~200 lines, ranking findings by epistemic confidence. This hot cache prevents context bloat while preserving critical learnings.

**Portability**: BREADCRUMBS (git notes) encode epistemic snapshots locally, surviving repo clone/transfer without cloud dependencies.

Source: MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md, complete diagram (lines 8–85); README.md §How It Works With Claude Code (line 219).

### 5. Calibration & Grounded Verification — Reality Check on AI Confidence

**What it does**: Empirica compares AI self-assessment (predicted confidence, stated readiness) against objective outcomes (test results, code quality metrics, task completion). This delta reveals whether the AI's confidence is justified or overconfident.

**Mechanism**: Brier Score calibration (proper scoring rule) computes how far AI confidence diverges from actual success. Dynamic thresholds are computed from calibration data — threshold = f(AI's historical accuracy on similar tasks). If AI claims 95% confidence but only succeeds 60% of the time on tasks where it claimed 95%, the next 95% claim gets a lower CHECK threshold.

**Grounded evidence**: Dual-track verification compares AI reasoning against:
- Test pass/fail results
- Git metrics (file churn, complexity metrics)
- Goal completion status
- Domain-specific success criteria (e.g., API contract compliance, security assertions)

Source: README.md §Prevents confident mistakes (line 35); CHANGELOG.md [1.7.0] "Brier Score Calibration"; PHASE_AWARE_CALIBRATION.md.

### 6. Cross-Project Search & Multi-Tenant Storage

**What it does**: Empirica supports multiple projects (e.g., "auth-service", "frontend", "cli-tool") in a single workspace. The AI can search across all project histories, finding patterns and prior solutions via semantic search.

**Mechanism**: Each project has a Qdrant vector collection (docs, memory, eidetic, episodic). The search API supports:
- `kind='eidetic'` — What have you learned? (episodic + personal memory)
- `kind='episodic'` — What happened? (project history, sequences of events)
- `kind='intelligence'` — Cross-domain knowledge (v1.7.7: new boost weights for collection-type relevance)

**Global search**: `--global` flag searches ALL projects' collections at once.

Source: CHANGELOG.md [1.7.5] "Cross-Project Search"; [1.7.7] "Intelligence search kind"; README.md §How It Works With Claude Code (line 220).

### 7. AI Workflow Pattern Mining — Learn From Your Own Behavior

**What it does**: Empirica detects repeated tool sequences (workflows) that the AI uses across transactions. Pattern mining surfaces which workflows work well (high success rate) and which lead to dead-ends.

**Mechanism**: Sequential pattern analysis (PrefixSpan algorithm) identifies repeated tool call sequences. Each pattern is ranked by:
- Frequency (how often does it appear)
- Success rate (what % of transactions using this pattern complete)
- Learning delta (did using this pattern improve epistemic vectors)

**Workflow suggestion engine**: When starting a new task, Empirica suggests workflows that succeeded on similar prior tasks (matched by goal keywords, code domain, etc.).

Source: CHANGELOG.md [1.7.7] "Workflow Pattern Mining" and "Workflow Suggestion Engine"; new `workflow-patterns` CLI command.

### 8. Natural Language Workflow — AI Operates the System Automatically

**What it does**: Users interact with Empirica via natural language. The AI (Claude Code, etc.) reads the statusline, interprets what's needed, and issues CLI commands automatically. Users never need to learn 150+ commands.

**Mechanism**: Empirica ships with system prompts (for Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Qwen, Roo) that teach the AI:
- How to read epistemic vectors from the statusline
- When to run investigation vs action
- Which CLI commands are available
- How to interpret CHECK gate decisions (investigate vs proceed)

The AI learns this once (via system prompt) and applies it across all sessions. Power users can still invoke commands directly: `empirica goals-list`, `empirica calibration-report`, etc.

### Sentinel Gate Decision Logic

```
IF noetic_phase:
  allow: investigation tools (read, grep, search, git, test runs)
  block: modification tools (write, commit, deploy)

IF check_phase:
  vectors = assess_current_state()
  thresholds = compute_thresholds(calibration_data)
  IF all(vectors[v] >= thresholds[v] for v in GATE_VECTORS):
    PROCEED to praxic
  ELSE:
    INVESTIGATE (loop back to noetic with guidance on what's missing)

IF praxic_phase:
  allow: modification tools (write, commit, deploy)
  block: other investigation (new unknowns require new PREFLIGHT)

IF closed_transaction:
  noetic_tools + safe bash allowed without new PREFLIGHT
```

## Installation & Usage

### Quick Start — Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
pip install empirica
empirica setup-claude-code
```

This command automatically configures:
- Epistemic hooks in `.claude/settings.json` (PreToolUse, SessionEnd, etc.)
- System prompt injection with empirica instructions
- Live statusline rendering
- MCP server for empirica CLI tools
- `.empirica/` project initialization

**First-time session:**
```bash
empirica onboard  # Interactive walkthrough
```

Then work normally — the AI manages the epistemic workflow automatically.

**For existing Claude Code projects** (preserve other hooks):
```bash
empirica setup-claude-code --force  # Only removes empirica's own hooks, preserves Railway, Superpowers, etc.
```

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Specific Use Cases Within Claude Code Workflows

1. **Investigation Phase Enforcement**: The Sentinel gate integrates with Claude Code's `/dh:work-backlog-item` skill, enforcing noetic (investigation) phases before tasks are allowed to modify code. This prevents the "acts before understanding" anti-pattern.

2. **Task Decomposition Measurement**: When Claude Code's task decomposition produces sub-tasks, Empirica measures epistemic state at each decomposition boundary. The AI must demonstrate understanding of the subtask before being allowed to implement it.

3. **Memory Persistence Across Milestones**: Claude Code's MEMORY.md is auto-curated by Empirica into a ranked index of findings, dead-ends, and learnings. This enables cross-milestone context without manual summarization — the AI bootstraps understanding from prior work in seconds.

4. **Calibration of Confident Mistakes**: When an AI's stated confidence (e.g., "I'm certain this authentication logic is correct, confidence 95%") is contradicted by test failures, Empirica adjusts future thresholds. Tasks where the AI was historically overconfident get higher Sentinel gates.

5. **Workflow Pattern Learning**: After 50+ Claude Code sessions, Empirica identifies which investigation patterns (read tests → check API → search examples) lead to successful implementations. New similar tasks get workflow suggestions based on prior success rates.

6. **Cross-Project Intelligence**: When working on multiple Claude Code projects, `--global` search surfaces solutions and patterns from prior projects without manual knowledge transfer. This compounds learning across projects.

### Why Empirica Matters for Claude Code Agents

- **Prevents context collapse**: 4-layer memory survives Claude Code's context compaction hooks
- **Grounds autonomy**: Sentinel gate prevents autonomous edits on shallow understanding
- **Measures learning**: Each milestone completion updates calibration, improving future estimations
- **Audit trail**: Complete transaction logs for debugging agent failures or understanding decision chains
- **Integrates seamlessly**: No Claude Code modifications needed — Empirica runs via hooks and MCP

---

## Limitations & Caveats

1. **Qdrant optional but important**: Vector search (eidetic/episodic queries) requires Qdrant. Without it, memory querying falls back to BM25 search (slower, less semantic). Installation: `pip install empirica[vector]` or run separately.

2. **Vision/OCR experimental**: The `empirica[vision]` extra (pytesseract, PIL, opencv) is marked experimental in pyproject.toml. Visual understanding for browser interactions or diagram analysis has limited test coverage.

3. **Thresholds are adaptive, not fixed**: Sentinel thresholds are computed from historical data per-project. New projects without calibration history use defaults (know: 0.75, engagement: 0.65) which may be too loose or too strict for your domain.

4. **MCP timeout at 30s**: All MCP tool calls have a 30-second timeout (configurable via `EMPIRICA_MCP_TIMEOUT`). Long-running investigations (e.g., expensive cross-project search) may timeout. Workaround: invoke directly via CLI for long operations.

5. **No cloud-native persistence**: Empirica is fundamentally local-first. The CORTEX_API_KEY integration for remote intelligence is experimental (v1.7.6). For production multi-user deployments, manual setup required.

6. **Git notes require push for portability**: BREADCRUMBS (epistemic snapshots in git notes) are portable across clones ONLY if explicitly pushed. Default: local-only. To share snapshots: `git push origin refs/notes/empirica/*`

7. **Context overhead on first run**: The system prompt and Tier 1 memory add ~2–3K tokens of always-loaded context. For memory-constrained deployments (e.g., GPT-4 Mini with tight context), use `setup-claude-code --lean` for 81% reduction (v1.7.0 feature).

8. **Platform-specific behaviors**: Claude Code integration is production (full hooks). Cursor/Cline via MCP only. Copilot/Gemini via system prompt only (no hooks). Compatibility matrix: see README.md §Platform Support.

---

## Key Learnings & Design Patterns

1. **Epistemic transactions over imperative tasks**: The noetic-praxic cycle inverts the typical "do first, measure later" pattern. Measurement-first gates prevent confident failures.

2. **Vectors over binary gates**: Rather than YES/NO "ready to act", 13 vectors give nuanced understanding. The AI might be high-confidence but low-signal (knows what it wants but missing info). Vectors reveal this.

3. **Calibration via proper scoring rules**: Brier Score (a strictly proper scoring rule) forces honest confidence reporting. If the AI is overconfident, the score penalizes it more than underconfidence. This incentivizes truthful self-assessment.

4. **Memory as ranked cache**: Auto-curation ranks findings by epistemic confidence, not by time or frequency. The AI sees the most epistemically solid learnings first, not the most recent.

5. **Portability via git notes**: Epistemic snapshots in git notes (BREADCRUMBS) survive repo transfer without central servers. Decentralized, version-controlled, human-readable (YAML).
